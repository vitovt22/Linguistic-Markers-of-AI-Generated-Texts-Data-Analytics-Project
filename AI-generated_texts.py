generated_texts = ['The Now We Can Begin (1920) by Crystal Eastman is classifiable as a crucial post-suffrage document that reflects on the sentiments and aspirations of American women in the aftermath of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. This is because its primary idea revolves around the notion that the right to vote, through a significant milestone, should mark the commencement and not the conclusion of the womens movement. This is based on the authors argument that women should now articulate their broader vision of freedom, encompass economic independence, occupational diversity, and the reevaluation of homemaking (Eastman, 1920). In regard to the early 1920s settings, this source is situated in the wake of the hard-fought battle for womens suffrage, where Eastmans words eco the transitional phase and capture the collective consciousness of women as they transitioned from advocating for the right to vote to articulating a comprehensive feminist agenda. In other words, this article serves as a response to the societal expectations that are imposed on women and the limitations they face while at the same time emphasizing the urgency of dismantling barriers to economic independence and professional pursuits. Additionally, Eastman advocates for a revolution in education where she challenges the traditional gender roles by proposing that both men and women ought to be proficient in both homemaking and various other professions. Arguably, this does reflect on the broader feminist discourse of the time as it pushed for a redefinition of womens role in society. Besides, Eastman does engage with the complex issue of motherhood, where she introduces the concept of voluntary motherhood and suggests economic rewards for mothers as a means of ensuring their independence while raising children (Eastman, 1920). In conclusion, this historical piece is a testament to the evolving feminist agenda post-suffrage and encapsulates the spirit of the time when women sought not just political equality but also a profound transformation in societal perceptions and structure. This aimed at achieving true freedom and economic independence, thus resonating with the idea of foundational principles in the ongoing struggle for gender equality.', 'Health promotion can be described as a process of supporting people in enhancing their mental and physical health and taking charge of it. Communities and individuals need empowerment to take charge of their own health within the social focus, and economic and environmental factors. The process of health promotion may assist people of all backgrounds and ages to overcome health iniquities and improve their life qualities (Workbook: Health Promotion, 2024). This article discusses initiatives in the United Kingdom aimed at promoting the health and well-being of a specific group. It introduces the Change4Life campaign, which aims to encourage children and their families to engage in more physical activity and adopt healthier eating habits for improved overall healthTop of Form. The paper will also describe the initiative, its goals and objectives, strategies and methods that are used in spreading the health promotion messages the campaigns services and partners, and assessments of the company\'s efficiency and effectiveness in the public health sector. The paper will also offer an assessment and evaluation of the campaign using health promotion models and concepts\nThe determinants of health, or the factors that influence the health of people and communities, are an important topic in health promotion. Dahlgren and Whitehead\'s (1991) Rainbow Model divides health determinants into six levels: individual lifestyle variables, social and community networks, living and working environments, overall socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental conditions, age, gender, and constitutional aspects. These variables interact, with various consequences on people\'s health outcomes. Income, education, employment, housing, and access to health care, for example, may all influence a person\'s risk of illness, stress tolerance, health practices, and health literacy.\nHealth promotions offer advantages to both specific targets and general public health. First, its communication offers education and awareness to the public about health risks and prevention, which allows the public to make great and educated decisions on their health acts. Health promotion campaigns promote healthier habits and lifestyles, which in turn improve overall well-being and lower the risk of chronic diseases (Workbook: Health Promotion, 2024). These initiatives also help reduce health inequalities by targeting disadvantaged populations and addressing socioeconomic factors that influence health. Further, health promotions use personalized messaging and treatments to overreach the general demography and underrepresented public to reduce health inequalities. Finally, they collaborate with a variety of groups such as healthcare professionals, government agencies corporate sectors, etc., to have an impact on a greater audience by combining the skills of these partners. In summary, health promotion initiatives assist in the promotion of public health by empowering the public and encouraging collaboration toward healthier communities.  \nThe initiative in focus in this paper is Change4Life which was launched by the Health and Social Care department in 2009. The reason for the rise of this initiative was the rise of obesity and associated health issues among the young and adult population in the UK. As per the NCMP (National Child Measurement Program) 21% and 31% of 4-5 year and 10-11-year-olds respectively were obese, this increased some other health-related issues such as type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart diseases, and other health issues. Due to this, Change4Life rose intending to prevent and create awareness of the poor diet habits and sedentary lifestyles towards health and assisted the public in adopting better life choices. \nChange4Life is based on a social marketing technique that uses commercial marketing concepts and methods to influence the behavior of a target audience for a social cause (Foodactive.org.uk, 2021). Change4Life propagates messages regarding health promotion using an assortment of mass media initiatives internet platforms, community participation, and collaborative efforts, all while promoting and encouraging behavior change in children and their families. Change4Life employs the following addresses and strategies:\nDeveloping a positive and compelled brand identity that communicates to the target demographic information and emphasizes the benefits of leading a healthy life.\nCreate distinctive phrases and logos, such as "Eat well, move more, live longer", "Sugar swaps", "Be food smart", and "10-minute shake up".\n Creating and disseminating media pieces, including TV and radio ads, posters, billboards, pamphlets, films, apps, and websites, to promote healthy eating and physical activity.\nOrganizing and funding local events, including roadshows, seminars, festivals, and sports clubs, to involve families and children in learning and practicing healthy behaviors.\nCollaborating with diverse partners, including supermarkets, food producers, schools, charities, celebrities, and health experts, to deliver and promote campaign messages and services.\nSince 2016, Aldi, an established retailer of groceries in the UK, has served as a vital partner of Change4Life. By motivating families and kids to adopt better eating habits and improve their physical activity levels, the partnership hopes to further the initiative\'s objectives (NHS, 2016. About Change4Life). Aldi\'s support for Change4Life comprises the following products and services:\n Offering a variety of healthy and economical food products, including fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meat, fish, and low-fat dairy, all labeled with the Change4Life emblem and nutritional information.\nOffer clients complimentary recipe cards, pamphlets, and magazines with healthy and easy-to-make meals and snacks, as well as recommendations for reducing sugar, salt, and fat intake.\nSponsoring and hosting the Change4Life 10 Minute Shake Up program, a summer effort that promotes daily physical exercise for youngsters inspired by Disney characters and tales. Aldi gives free exercise packets, wristbands, and stickers to children who sign up for the program, and it also organizes in-store activities and competitions to encourage physical activity and good eating.\nFunding and supporting the School Sport Partnership, a network of schools and organizations dedicated to providing high-quality physical education and sports opportunities for children and youth. \nUNICEF, an international organization committed to safeguarding and advocating for young people\'s and youth\'s rights and well-being, is an additional significant Change4Life collaborator. UNICEF has worked together with Change4Life since 2019 to advance the goals of the campaign and encourage children and their families to eat more nutritiously and exercise regularly. UNICEF partnerships with Change4Life to provide services such as creating and implementing the Eat Like A Champ program, a UK-based project aimed at improving nutrition and health awareness among primary school students aged 9 to 10. UNICEF collaborates with Change4Life to provide free online materials for teachers on issues such as healthy eating, food categories, food labeling, hydration, physical activity, and sustainability. UNICEF also collaborates with Change4Life to recruit and train volunteer ambassadors, such as athletes, cooks, and nutritionists, who visit schools and share their experiences and knowledge in healthy living. \nDisney is Change4Life\'s third major partner, a global entertainment company that develops and distributes a wide range of media goods, including films, television episodes, games, and merchandise based on well-known and adored characters and storylines. Disney has collaborated with Change4Life since 2014 to promote the campaign\'s goals and encourage families and children to eat healthier and exercise more. Disney\'s engagement with Change4Life includes the following services:\nDeveloped and promoted the Change4Life 10 Minute Shake Up program, a summer effort that promotes daily physical exercise for children based on Disney characters and storylines. Disney offers the program\'s creative content and digital platform, which includes an online quiz, exercise videos, games, and an app that engages children and families in engaging and interactive ways to learn about and practice physical activity.\n Developing and distributing the Change4Life Be Food Smart program, a year-round campaign that promotes healthy eating habits and reduces sugar, salt, and fat consumption. Disney provides the program\'s creative material as well as the digital platform, which includes the web tool, app, videos, and games that give information, advice, and direction on how to eat well and be food-wise.\nPromoting the Change4Life campaign through various media channels and platforms, including the Disney Channel, website, social media accounts, and stores, reaching millions of children and families in the UK and beyond.\nThe Change4Life campaign\'s impact on public health may be assessed using a range of approaches and criteria, including reach, awareness, engagement, behavior change, and health outcomes. According to the Change4Life Three Year Social Marketing Strategy (2011), the campaign achieved the following results and impacts.\nThe campaign reached over 85% of the target audience of families with children aged 5-11 in England, with over 2.9 million families joining and receiving regular assistance.\nThe campaign raised knowledge and comprehension of the health dangers of obesity and the advantages of a healthy lifestyle among the target population. It also changed their attitudes and beliefs towards healthy behavior.\nThe campaign influenced behavior change among the target population, leading to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, reduced sugar, salt, and fat intake, and increased physical activity levels.\nThe campaign improved the health outcomes of the target population by lowering overweight and obesity, avoiding obesity-related illnesses, and enhancing their quality of life and well-being.\nThe Change4Life initiative may be evaluated and criticized using a variety of health promotion concepts and structures, such as the model of health beliefs, the Theory of planned behavior, the Theory of Social cognition, and the Transtheoretical Theory. These models give an understanding of the factors that influence health conduct and behavioral change in the target audience, and they also provide an evaluation of the campaign\'s accomplishment. As an instance, the Health Behavior Model may be utilized to look into how the marketing effort discusses the target audience\'s assessed vulnerability, severity, advantages, obstacles, and cues to take action, which decides the likelihood of adopting wanted health habits (NSMC. 2009. Change4Life). Similarly, the Theory of planned conduct lets you conduct an assessment of the campaign\'s impact on the target audience\'s attitude, subjective norm, and impression of control over their behavior, which all influence their intentions and actual actions. The Social Cognitive Theory of Advertising investigates how the advertising program promotes behavior change as well as sustainability in the target audience including a process of reciprocal determinism, learning through observation, confidence, and outcome expectations. Furthermore, the Transtheoretical Model of Change evaluates the prospective audience\'s degree of transformation and investigates how the marketing initiative\'s actions and approaches correspond to their preparation and objectives.\nA thorough health promotion program called Change4Life aims to improve children\'s and families\' general health and well-being in the United Kingdom. The impact this campaign has on public welfare and the effectiveness of its tactics are just two of the factors that must be taken into account while evaluating its success. According to Change4Life\'s (2011) Three-Year Social Marketing Strategy, the program has yielded noteworthy outcomes:\nReach: The campaign reached over 85% of the target audience of families with children aged 5-11 in England, with over 2.9 million families joining and receiving regular assistance.\nAwareness: Change4Life raised knowledge and comprehension of the health dangers of obesity and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle among the target population. It also changed their attitudes and beliefs towards healthy behavior.\nBehavior Change: The campaign influenced behavior change among the target population, leading to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, reduced sugar, salt, and fat intake, and increased physical activity levels.\nHealth Outcomes: Change4Life improved the health outcomes of the target population by lowering overweight and obesity rates, preventing obesity-related illnesses, and enhancing their quality of life and well-being.\nThese findings show that Change4Life is successful in promoting healthier lifestyles and preventing obesity-related health concerns among UK families and children. However, constant monitoring and assessment are required to determine the campaign\'s long-term impact and suggest areas for improvement. Future studies might look at tracking behavior change trends, measuring long-term health consequences, and investigating the campaign\'s scalability and durability for a larger public health impact.\nConclusion\nThis article concludes with an examination of the health-promoting campaign Change4Life, which works to promote more physical activity, better diet, and overall better health for UK children and their families. The discussion covers the objectives of the campaign in simple terms, methods for communicating, partnerships, and an assessment of the effect that it is having on the health of the public. Various heath-promotion concepts and frameworks, including the Transtheoretical Model, the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Theory of Social Cognitive Theory, and the Wellness Belief Model, are used for evaluating the campaign. The report claims that Change4Life leverages digital advertising to target health determinants and provide families and kids with the tools that they require to make better decisions, offering a novel and encompassing approach to avoiding obesity and management. Strengths and weaknesses of the campaign are identified, including its positive brand identity, extensive partnership network, and use of diverse strategies, but also challenges like insufficient long-term funding, potential for stigmatization, and limited evidence of behavior change. The essay proposes recommendations for campaign enhancement, such as increased audience involvement, improved monitoring and evaluation, diversified funding sources, and addressing broader structural and policy issues impacting family and child health. Conclusively, the article emphasizes the significance of Change4Life as a relevant program promoting public health and physical activity in the United Kingdom, while suggesting potential areas for further development and expansion to fulfill its objectives.', 'Title: The Haunted Journey of Elizabeth Aldridge In the spring of 1854, a young woman named Elizabeth Aldridge stood at the edge of her family’s farm in rural Pennsylvania, staring at the distant woods. Her heart beat faster as she remembered her father’s warning. “Never go near the old mill,” he had told her countless times. But Elizabeth was not one to follow rules blindly, especially when the whispers of the village were so compelling. The story of the ghost that haunted the abandoned mill had both frightened and fascinated her since she was a child. Now, at twenty-two, she felt the restless pull of something beyond the everyday, something that called her into the unknown. Elizabeth was not a woman of great beauty or conventional charm. She was plain in appearance, with sharp eyes and a determined jawline. But there was something in her spirit that could not be easily contained. She had inherited her father’s stubbornness and her mother’s fierce independence, traits that served her well during the many trials she had faced in her life. It was this temperament that had driven her to live on the farm, working the land alongside her father after her mother’s passing. But something had always felt incomplete, as if the world held a mystery she had yet to uncover. The scar on her left palm, a result of a childhood accident involving a runaway horse, was a constant reminder of the risks she had taken in her life. It had never fully healed, and the skin was thickened and rough. Her father always claimed that the scar was a sign of her recklessness. But Elizabeth knew better. It was a mark of survival, of the many dangers she had faced and the many more she would face in her future. On the day she decided to venture into the woods toward the old mill, the air felt heavy. The village had been abuzz with tales of a spirit that haunted the mill, a woman who had drowned there years ago. Some said she was the victim of a tragic accident; others whispered that the miller had murdered her. But whatever the truth, the ghost had been seen many times, wandering near the mill, calling out in sorrowful tones. Elizabeth had always wondered if the stories were just that—stories to scare children and keep them from exploring the dark corners of the world. But today, she was no longer interested in speculation. She needed to know for herself. As she walked through the dense trees, the faint sound of a distant creek echoed in the silence. The wind had picked up, and Elizabeth’s breath came in short bursts as her pulse quickened. Her boots pressed down on the damp earth with each step, and the smell of wet leaves filled the air. Her eyes darted from one shadow to another, but she kept moving, determined to reach the mill before the sun set. When she finally arrived, the old mill stood in the clearing like a dark, abandoned monument to something lost. Its windows were shattered, and the door hung loosely on its hinges, creaking with the wind. Elizabeth hesitated at the threshold, feeling a chill creep down her spine. She stepped inside, the floorboards groaning under her weight. The air was thick with dust and decay, and she felt a presence around her, a weight in the room that seemed to pull at her very soul. “Elizabeth…” The voice came softly, a whisper so faint it might have been the wind. But Elizabeth knew better. She turned, and for a moment, she saw the figure of a woman standing at the far end of the room, bathed in a pale, ghostly light. Her heart skipped a beat, and she froze in place. The woman was dressed in a long, flowing gown, her face pale and sorrowful, her eyes hollow and searching. “Who are you?” Elizabeth asked, her voice trembling despite her efforts to sound brave. The woman didn’t answer. Instead, she slowly reached out a hand, her fingers thin and translucent. Elizabeth felt an overwhelming sadness, a deep sense of loss, flood through her. She took a cautious step forward, her scarred palm aching, as if the wound on her hand were somehow connected to the spirit’s sorrow. She had heard the stories—how the ghost had once been a young woman in love, how she had drowned in the creek, her lover’s betrayal the cause of her tragic end. But Elizabeth didn’t want to hear the story again. She wanted to understand it. She stepped closer, and as she did, the ghost vanished, leaving only the soft rustling of the wind behind. The mill was silent once more. As Elizabeth walked back to the farm, she felt an unexplainable shift in the air around her. The scar on her palm throbbed as if the ghost’s touch had awakened something inside her. She would never be the same again. The mystery had been uncovered, but the questions it had raised were even more unsettling than the answers. Elizabeth’s life would go on, but the memory of the mill, of the ghost, and of the scar that connected them would remain with her forever. She had faced the unknown, and in doing so, had discovered something deeper within herself—a strength that would carry her through the trials that awaited her in the years to come.', "Animal testing is a topic that poses a critical ethical dilemma. This essay discusses these ethical issues, considers viable alternatives, examines the reliability of most animal testing procedures, and supports the ban. It calls into question the prioritization of human interests over animal welfare. In addition, it examines the appropriateness of basing health-related decisions on findings generated from animals. This dialogue emphasizes the importance of an empathetic and ethically guided approach in scientific studies that considers animals’ rights and strives towards more reliable, humane options. The primary objection to animal testing is that it is unethical and is subjected to pain and distress. Animal testing is ethically questionable, even if such tests were meant for cosmetics, everyday objects, and drugs. Even greater concern is the long-term implications for their lives even after the experiments have been completed and even the immediate pain. When confined in cages, the pets cannot exercise their normal behavior and natural environment, which is crucial for their health and happiness (LaFollette & Shanks, 2020). It is one of the major ethical problems as animals’ lives are taken for granted while they are entitled to living rights like all other living entities. These circumstances deny them existence for a living, but they live just as test subjects outside of nature: freedom, fresh air, and sunlight. This ethical perspective is against animal testing, arguing that animals have a right to live without any human suffering. Ethical considerations surrounding animal testing are important, and we must consider them. It is based on the principle of appreciating all life forms. With a growing humane society, hurting animals for some benefit is becoming less and less acceptable. The ethics in the contemporary world are reflected by the emerging issue of ethical consumerism, which signifies the shift in perspective. Consumers are increasingly becoming selective and aware of their choices through purchasing only those products that do not involve animal testing, an indication of a change in consumer values. It clearly shows society’s acceptance of animals' rights. These are intelligent creatures and not tools for use by humans. Such reluctance to subscribe to the use of animals in product testing also exemplifies that animal rights are taking on greater acceptance, and a stricter standard of ethics goes beyond the individual benefits of humans only. Such a change of perception is one of the major steps toward taking a kinder position toward any animal. In vitro testing, computer models, and human tissue are alternative methods developed due to scientific progress. Such means of communication are morally better and often more effective. This data applies more to human responses to medicines and skin care products. It matters because most animal models do not accurately predict human reactions (Voelkl et al., 2020). Such changes represent an ethical research approach that offers real alternatives to animal tests. Hence, these developments will likely reduce dependency on animal test cases and improve data quality regarding human needs. The reliability of animal testing is due to vast biological disparities between animals and humans. Such tests provide results that may not be meaningful in human situations. One of the examples is the thalidomide drug, which was believed to be safe in animals but produced serious congenital anomalies in human beings. It only illustrates the fundamental dangers of relying on animal-based testing for matters affecting human safety. It demonstrates a necessity for more relevantly applicable and truthful tests, as well as that there is nothing unethical about animal-based results except that they can be incorrect and dangerous if applied to human health. Therefore, it should be outlawed to carry out animal testing. It is an ethical problem and relates to scientists’ integrity and quality. The fact that they can use more humane and accurate alternatives instead of further hurting them does not justify this. Society must adopt methods considering every aspect of life and progress scientific study.", 'In the podcast episode "Did Artificial Intelligence Just Get Too Smart?" from "The Daily," Michael Barbaro discusses some of the latest advances in artificial intelligence. This paper will provide a detailed overview of the principal ideas discussed during the episode and suggest critical reflection owing to ChatGPT\'s effect on computing and society.\nSummary:\n\n\nResponse:\nThe introduction of ChatGPT  computing, . On the bright side, ChatGPT’s ability Siri or Alexa) .. Nevertheless, come with  concern about its projection in misuse and ethical issues.\nThe versatility of ChatGPT is evident in the practice whereby one host requires different writing styles depending on specific assignments they assign other people. Still, some tasks are given to a robot that answers speedily yet yields remarkable results when tested by Mondal. This problem immediately reveals the versatility of the model. It shows that it understands language in detail by demonstrating its ability to create content under specific language from Shakespearean or even 1940s mobsters. However, despite the cure of depth to which Chat GPT is adopted, it will pose a significant challenge to prompt adoption. This would be a severe matter that arises within its implementation.\n Additionally, with more people using the technology, misinformation increases, biased content generation becomes more prevalent, and unethical activities grow even larger without solid ethical protocols for users to follow. The deficiency of the above method may result in unexpected outcomes, whereby ChatGPT is used maliciously to develop content that does not reflect reality or involves wrongs (Burhan Fatih Koçyiğit and Alikhan Zhaksylyk). In response to these possible hazards, prompt measures need to be taken, including the development of ethical criteria for the entire content confirmation process in AI algorithms with transparency and user education programs. \nCoordinately, it is a proactive approach by developers, users, and regulators to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT with minimal risks anticipated on opportunity costs and ethics breaches. The AI community becomes an interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure technology adoption resides alongside ethics along the right path, providing responsible behavior by actors intending to deploy or use AI systems. The potential outcomes of ChatGPT can be observed by reflecting on my time as a student at Cleveland State University. However, technology may be a great tool to create augmenting content if one is doing academic tasks, but there is still a risk of using it too much (Ray). Finding a middle ground between considering ChatGPT as an appliance and holding deep fidelity to the true origin of one\'s work is, therefore, vital in matters concerning the reputation of academic undertakings. \nIn summary, with regard to the fact that it revealed remarkable features of ChatGPT and its possible difference in response to our lives. With the adoption of this revolutionary technology, there is a need to walk through a skinny line that differentiates innovation from accountability, ensuring that AI, as a good product as it has done, is earned positively with essentials in creativity and critical thinking in and out of school. With the democratization of AI tools such as ChatGPT, we wonder about the direction we want to be presented with technology; ethics and human responsibility are a part of forming the future of artificial intelligence.', 'Effective implementation of information systems brings forth different benefits to an organization. To begin with, the foremost among these is the ability to streamline efficiency in data processing and management, a key factor in the running of the business. Subsequently, information systems have helped with the automation of routine tasks, which in turn have resulted in minimal errors while increasing the data processing timeframe. This not only contributes to the optimization of daily operations but also enables the organization to respond promptly to the dynamics of the market (Bidgoli, 2021). Nevertheless, this impact does extend beyond operational enhancement to encompass the transformation of the organizational culture to softer a workforce that is adept at navigating a complex information landscape. In addition to this, employees become information-literate, which results in a more empowered and agile workforce. At the same time, transaction-processing systems that are integral to information systems assume a vital role in the achievement of operational efficiency. This implies that, by automating transactions, these systems help counter possible errors and significantly hasten the processing times (Bidgoli, 2021). This is a critical factor to be taken into account as it helps business entities to ensure they have a smooth and precise execution of transactional activities. In addition, information systems have further contributed to the enhancement of the decision-making process through the Management Information Systems (MIS) that provide decision-makers with timely and relevant information to enable strategic planning and proactive management approaches (Bidgoli, 2021). Moreover, the impact of these systems does extend to functional areas within the business, whereby, for instance, it facilitates seamless coordination, communication, and collaboration between the finance setting and the marketing framework. The outcome of these impact is the overall enhancement of efficiency across the different branches of the business to imply that effective information system goes beyond technical optimization (Bidgoli, 2021). In other words, the importance and applications of information systems in functional areas of a business are evident in the way this system is able to streamline different processes within the organization to contribute to overall efficiency.', "The chosen code of ethics is provision 1. The hallmark of this provision is to instill a culture in nurses to handle patients in high regard for their lives, which are valuable and sacred and thus deserve the most respectful treatment and experience at the hands of the nurses. It requires that “The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person” (American Nurses Association, 2015, p.1). The subcategory relating to an identifiable ethical incident in the workplace is Subcategory 1.1: Respect for Human Dignity, which emphasizes that nurses must treat all individuals with compassion and respect, regardless of their circumstances, and advocate for their right to healthcare (American Nurses Association, 2015). The subcategory underlines the need to offer care that dignifies human lives, irrespective of individual differences or circumstances exhibited by the patients. \nEthical Issues in a Workplace Situation\nWorking in a correctional facility has exposed me to ethical incidents of varying magnitudes. One day, an inmate complained of shortness of breath severally and requested immediate medical attention. However, one of the guards refused to open the inmate's cell, stating that the inmate had not reported chest pain, self-harm, or bleeding—some of the only conditions that justify opening a cell in segregation. This violated the inmate's right to dignified care, as the guard prioritized institutional rules over the inmate’s healthcare needs. Unfortunately, this incident put the health and life of the inmate on the line. The second guard, who was more concerned, contacted me for assistance. The guard described the dire situation of the inmate, requesting immediate attention if possible. As the nurse on duty, I had to advocate for the inmate by insisting that the cell be opened so I could assess and provide medical care.\n\nEffects of the Subcategory Violation on the Patient, Staff, or Others\nA close examination of subcategory 1.1 of provision 1 highlights the principles of ensuring human dignity in interaction with patients. It points out that all patients, regardless of their background characteristics, deserve to be accorded relevant compassion and care and must be allowed to enjoy their human rights (American Nurses Association, 2015). In the context of the incident, failing to enable the inmate to access healthcare services violated his right to healthcare services. Regrettably, it put the inmate into a situation of heightened anxiety due to the severity of the complications. According to Sethi et al. (2023), breathlessness is associated with increased mortality. That shows that keeping the inmate untreated could have contributed to severe complications. \nUndesirably, the situation set the correctional facility’s staff against each other. The first and second guards had differing opinions on this issue due to a conflict of institutional policies with the ethical principles in the care of patients. Refusal by the guard to open the cell put the safety of the patient at stake, a situation that worsened and painted the correctional facility as unsafe for the inmates. The tension raised accountability issues on leaders entrusted to ensure the safety of the inmates. As a healthcare expert responsible for the health and well-being of patients, I felt overwhelmed by how the incident played out, knowing that the life of the inmate was at stake. The scenario underscored the sentiments of Ashton (2017), who noted that nurses must be cognizant of institutional policies in their workplaces. Unfortunately, the institutional policies in the correctional facility slowed down the administration of healthcare services to needy inmates, especially those put in segregation cells. \nNursing Actions to Prevent Violations\nIt is essential to take proactive actions to prevent future violations of the provision 1 subcategory 1.1 in the workplace. Primarily, I would advocate for clear policies and protocols, especially during medical emergencies, to guide how inmates can access urgent care. The delay in administering patient care in the scenario was due to conflicting institutional policies that impended the mobilization of healthcare resources to the inmate. Another essential action is educating correctional facility staff on aspects of medical emergencies. It is vital to empower the staff to discern when inmates encounter medical emergencies. With such knowledge, staff are more likely to be receptive to health issues raised by inmates. Such education will make staff more sensitive to the health needs of inmates, including those in segregation programs. Lastly, enriching relationships between healthcare teams and other staff in the facility will be impactful. Cultivating good relationships with other staff helps in promoting a good working environment for healthcare teams. Such efforts help improve how facility staff understand the perspectives of healthcare teams in discharging care to the inmates. \nEthical Dilemma\nThe scenario presented a delicate ethical dilemma. The principles of autonomy and beneficence, as enshrined in the nurses’ code of ethics conflicted with security interests of the correctional facilities, primarily because the segregated inmate was classified as high risk due to his negative behaviors. Varkey (2020) highlighted that autonomy empowers patients to demand their preferred medical attention, requiring the healthcare team to engage in swift activities that do good to patients to improve their well-being. Unfortunately, practicing these principles was problematic because the guards sought to exercise caution in how they could handle the inmate put in segregation. The tension to conform to institutional policies in handling inmates in segregation and the need to respond to inmates’ health needs urgently created an ethical dilemma. \nNurse Advocate Actions to Avoid Violations or an Ethical Dilemma\nNurses stationed in institutions have a role in promoting the well-being of their clients. According to Ashton (2017), nurse students working in correctional facilities must show care and concern for the inmates by championing the fulfillment of their needs. In the incident in my workplace, I advocated for the need to respond to the inmate's medical emergency by liaising with the security guards. I explained to them the importance of timely intervention in health matters to help avert severe complications until the guards yielded. \nOne approach to advocacy to prevent violation is influencing policy changes in the workplace to align with the code of ethics in healthcare. For instance, lobbying the facility's management to harmonize the intersection between the institutional policies and ethical responsibilities of nurses in providing care to inmates at the point of need will provide a ground for nurses to practice their codes of ethics. Chiu et al. (2021) affirmed that policy advocacy helps enforce structural changes that benefit the population. Structural changes in the administrative policies of the correctional facility will enable nurses to practice their codes of ethics in the care of patients in full scope. \nAnother important approach is through organizational-wide awareness and training. Structuring training on adherence to the code of ethics and how the leadership can facilitate a better working environment is a suitable way to help staff and leadership of the facility understand the essence of the healthcare team and how adherence to the code of ethics improves the performance of nurses. This is the best way to lobby for the support of nurses in their mandate of ensuring they dispense timely and quality care to the inmates. Training will help the stakeholders understand the inevitable role of healthcare teams, which will help consolidate their support towards offering better health services. \nFuture Professional Nurse Actions\nNurses must actively chart a path for better dispensation of healthcare services to all needy populations, including inmates. One way to engage as a professional nurse is to intensify advocacy in local and national jurisdictions. In this case, establishing partnerships with political leaders would help legislate policies that affirm the need to confirm the code of ethics to better the lives of populations, including inmates. Chiu et al. (2021) applauded the nursing profession for its commitment to political processes that better the working of healthcare teams. Participation at this level will help safeguard against violations of any of the codes of ethics. Another avenue for advocacy is ethics leadership. As a professional nurse, I can take charge of leadership positions as an ethics officer. Doing so will put me in a position to instill a culture of ethical compliance and advocate for more policies to enhance compliance with ethics in my workplace. Lastly, participation in training programs in my professional life is a sound way to keep enhancing ethical standards. The best way to do so is by engaging nursing organizations to sponsor educational programs, for instance, in my workplace. Chiu et al. (2021) pinpointed the active involvement of nursing organizations in advocacy activities.

", 'Shirley Jackson\'s "Jack the Ripper" is a novel that will not fail to leave a lasting impression on you, as it creates a perfect blend of horror in the midst of the rich history of art and literature. In the course of defining the Ten Culturally Relevant Horror Stories of the 20th and 21st centuries, Jackson\'s story should be given its due recognition for being the only work of its kind in the genre. This essay is going to investigate three major aspects using the BEAM approach, each of them will be going to the into the intricate layers of "Jack the Ripper" and make it a remarkable horror masterpiece. The horror genre, in fact, has a target of scaring and perturbing at the end, and "Jack the Ripper" is successful in that by using a unique perspective. The supernatural replaces instead with the apprehension circulating among the mob concerning Jack the Ripper\'s identity. The story takes place in London of the Victorian era, using those actual historical events to make the story more frightening. This horror genre classification as an initial column of the narrative\'s depth is another pillar in this understanding. The deeper we go, the sided aspect of "Jack the Ripper" emerges as a perfect blend of the artistic and literary traditions of the Victorian period.\nBackground: Defining Horror in "Jack the Ripper"\nThis paper will be grounded on the fact that the story "Jack the Ripper" by Shirley Jackson is an undisputed masterpiece in the horror genre before it will delve into the nuanced contextual exploration of the story. It is the horror genre, as a literary and cinematic category, that relies primarily on the evocation of fear and of unsettling feelings inside the audience. It lives on the exploitation of darkness, blood and the unknown, using them to bring the audience into the story as if they were a part of it, which makes them feel the experience on a visceral level. Although the subjective and psychological nature of the story of Jackson may be veiled, it is inseparable from the fundamental features of the horror genre (Antoszek 855).\n"Jack the Ripper" horror does not conceal itself in figures of supernatural entities or fantastic creatures, but rather, it is the chilling shadow of a real character that makes his case so terrifying. The infamous Jack the Ripper, whose bloody series of escapades deserved to be called the most horrific one in the 19th century England, is the living horror. Through a strategic use of this historical criminal as Jackson did, he channels the collective fear and curiosity around his crimes; it is through this that he creates an ominous atmosphere in the story. Through purposefully tying the horror to the real-world horrors of that time, the narrative brings to life a gripping story that draws its power from the harsh truths of the time, and it does so by immersing readers in an exploration of the darkest areas of human nature (Anwer 438).\nEvidence: A Contextual Exploration within Art and Literature\nTo elucidate the complex web of art and literature imbedded in the "Jack the Ripper" we must conduct a profound analysis of these realms. Shirley Jackson develops her plot in the setting of Victorian age at the end of the 19th century, where the serial killer Jack the Ripper committed his crimes against women. The Victorian era is the same time when the artists were flourishing, and their output were intricately designed with gothic motifs. Through anchoring her work in this historical and artistic background, Jackson reminds readers not to only look at the surface and to avoid the simplistic condemnation of the female character.\nThe process of going back in time through historical research brings to light a shocking fact - the presence of violence against women in media and literature of the Victorian era. The macabre theme was the major socio-cultural interest during this period and was expressed in various artistic forms such as painting, literature, and performance where violence was very aesthetized. They were the embodiments of the existing norms and values which then were replicated and disseminated by society as a whole, thus, contributing to a general cultural attitude towards women violence (Cardin).\nThe explicit reference to Jack the Ripper in Shirley Jackson\'s narrative serves as a basis for an artistic response that reminds us of these traditions. It reveals the mutual connection between the cruel reality of Victorian period and the artistic side of violence and brutality that pervaded the cultural milieu of the Victorian era. With her sophisticated background, Jackson compels her audience to face not only the horrors within the story but also the widespread assumption in the society that praised violence in a specific historical era.\nThis art-literature contextual analysis within the "Jack the Ripper" narrative reinvents it as a horror story that is more than just a mirror of the societal attitudes and artistic representations of the period. Through making the reader place themselves in the historical and cultural context, Jackson pushes them to face the ugly realities that connect the narrative to the horror that have transcended the borders of the story to deliver a thought-provoking commentary on the everlasting effect of historical violence on today’s perception (Connor 77).\nArgument: Rethinking the Female Protagonist\'s Plight\nThe inner structure of “Jack the Ripper” by Shirley Jackson which is a woman protagonist’s story unfolds a renewed perspective on the character which needs to be different from the usual victim-blaming narratives. This narrative goes beyond the personal approach of placing blame on the characters, instead, it encourages the readers to look deeply into the society and artistic works that fuel violence against women.\nWith the use of Jack the Ripper’s horrendous murders as a backdrop, Jackson weaves them into the historical fabric of artistic and literary trends during the Victorian era, in doing so, he purposefully shifts the narrative to the foreground. The author does not attribute the blame entirely to the character, instead she challenges the readers to ponder the structural and societal norms as well as artistic depictions that perpetuate the violence against women.\nJackson’s reasoning, however, goes beyond the immediate horror portrayed in the story by also examining the psychological horror found in the society, art and literature. While readers share the distressed experiences of the narrator, they are left to interrogate and reflect on the larger societal themes that drive and sustain the abuse and violence against women. "Jack the Ripper" is now a literary mirror that is not only a reflection of the horrors of a specific historic moment but of the disquieting images of the structures of society that are still shaping the views on gender-based violence. Jackson\'s work allows for this viewpoint and becomes a meaningful social critique, thus creating an opportunity for a reexamination of the norms and artistic representations that contribute to the issue of violence against women.\nMethod: Understanding Motivations and Literary Traditions\nFor understanding why Convicting murderer Jack the Ripper was brought into the story by Jackson, a systematic approach should include analyzing the historical context, literary traditions and the underlying motivations of the story. Consequently, Jackson forms a connection between the crimes and the artistic representation of his period which serves to link reality and fiction, thus posing a significant question for the readers: who is the real culprit? The insight into the artistic and literary patterns of the late 19th century gives a context for understanding the novel\'s thematic layers (Morrison and Pedersen). The manner in which Jackson approaches history and re-examines it through her own methodological lens provides a complex angle that can only be described as more than just horror. It brings the story to a new level of social and cultural analysis.\nConclusion\nIn the final analysis, the 1978 "Jack the Ripper" can be regarded not only as a horror story but also as a meditation on the social norms and the artistic tradition of that era. Shirley Jackson’s clever positioning of herself within the expansive realms of arts and literature puts readers in the position where they have to grapple with the legacy of historical violence against women. This narrative approach makes "Jack the Ripper" a cultural icon, and the story sheds light on how the crimes of the past continue to influence our perception to this day. While we go through the details of "Jack The Ripper", it quickly becomes clear that "Jack The Ripper" should be treated as a masterpiece that deserves to be on the list of the 10 most culturally relevant horror stories of the 20th and 21st centuries.', "This paper aims to analyze the impact of Germany’s energy policy on Russian-German relations in the energy sector between the years 2010 and 2023 employing both quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Energiewende – the ambitious German plan of a gradual shift away from fossil fuels and nuclear energy and transitioning toward renewables – has impacted the bilateral energy relations with Russia to a large extent. Using data analysis of trade statistics the trend in the volumes and the composition of the German energy imports from Russia are examined and the results point towards a somewhat diversified scenario, where Germany is diversifying its imports away from Russian fossil fuel and integrating more of the renewable energy imports into its energy portfolio. In parallel, the qualitative examination of the bilateral diplomatic relations and statements, and the negotiations reveal changes in their tone and of the priorities of both countries during this transition. Different authors points out that the current literature has a dearth of research on national energy policies and international energy relations. Energiewende studies show that German policy to change has led the country to increase measures to diversify and secure its supply of energy from the Russian Federation and at the same time advance sustainable energy transformation. The discussion synthesises these outcomes, explaining how the provided policy has not only the nature of trade relationships but also diplomatic affairs and European energy security. Energiewende has changed the Russo-German energy relations in the sense that Germany is now trying to reduce its dependency on Russian energy resources and become more sustainable in terms of the energy it uses, on the other hand, Russia has both opportunities and threats that are connected with the process of the energiewende. This research adds to the existing literature on the effects of shifts in national energy systems on relations at the international level and guides policymakers who endeavour to achieve a harmonious combination between energy responsibility and geopolitical factors.Overview Of Germany's Energiewende Policy\nEnergiewende of Germany can be metaphorically translated as 'energy transformation'; it is a radical and multifaceted plan of changes to the energy landscape of the country. Officially started in the early 2000s, the Energiewende's major aim was to reduce Germany's reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear power while increasing green energy usage. In the policy framework, the government has the objective of a higher proportion of the key renewable sources of electricity, such as wind, solar and biomass, and improvements in energy efficiency across all sectors of the country's economy (Edo, 2023). At the core of the Energiewende is a two-fold plan: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 in relation to 1990 levels and eliminating nuclear power by 2022. \nThat can be best attributed to the early energy transition movement that began in the early 1970s and the 1980s in Germany due to the worldwide increasing concern for the environment and as an imperative move to vagrant the risks associated with nuclear energy. These concerns were further heightened by the nuclear explosion in Chernobyl in 1986, which had a blow to the German energy policy. The formalization of the Energiewende policy in the 2000s became more processed; one of the earliest examples of this is the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) 2000, which aimed to foster the development of renewable energy generation for connection to the grid (Sturm, 2020). \n The Energiewende policies have been accompanied by high levels of policy revolutions, such as legal feed-in tariffs and subsidies, as well as strict legal requirements on energy efficiency. These measures have resulted in the development of a major renewable energy industry in Germany, mainly wind and solar energy, making Germany one of the leading sheds of renewable energy in the world (Heering and Gustafson, 2021). As much as there has been a shift in the structure of the industry, the change has not come without some difficulties. Some challenges that have been realized include the fluctuating nature of renewable energy sources, the requirements for energy grid updates, as well as costs of retiring nuclear and coal energy. However, the policy has brought out controversy regarding the social and economic costs, such as high electricity bills and implications for the competency of the German industry.\n1.2  Importance of Russo-German energy relations\n Russo-German energy relations have always been at the very core of the two countries’s economic and foreign policy vectors and heavily impacted their bilateral relation and the EU energy methodology. Germany has been one of Russia’s biggest customers, importing natural gas for years, and now constitutes an important part of its industry, including home heating. The relationship is mutually beneficial: On the same note, while Germany has obtained a guaranteed and comparatively cheap energy supply, Russia has obtained a guaranteed market for considerable energy exports, which forms a significant aspect of the Russian economy. This energy interdependence has been a key to the development of diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries and has not been abolished even during political tensions. \n This energy relationship can be described as quite important given the volume and the levels of organizational infrastructures developed by the two countries in the sphere of energy cooperation. Such assets like Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 have become representatives of interdependence as they directly connect Russian gas fields with German consumers, thus excluding transit countries and, therefore, transit risks (Björkman, 2023). These pipelines have not only ensured the continuous provision of energy to Germany but also ensured the solidification of Russian energy exports to the European continent, hence enhancing the interconnection between the Russian and German economies. It has proved crucial in Germany’s energy security, especially as it started its Energiewende by phasing out nuclear energy and downing on coal.\nHowever, it is within the context of the above-stated that the role of Russo-German energy relations transcends the mere economic activities of buying and selling goods and services and power politics. Because Germany imports much of its natural gas from Russia, it actively participates in the EU’s energy policymaking as an intermediary on behalf of Russia (Nebot Pérez, 2023). Energy cooperation has remained one of the most sustainable features of Russo-German relations despite the general political crisis that has characterized Russia’s relations with the West, which is a result of factors such as the Russian intrusion in Ukraine in 2014, among other things (Brummer, 2022). Germany has had some energy relations with Russia that have, time and again, made it uncomfortable with its partners; the United States has taken a stand at some point regarding Europe’s reliance on Russian energy and how the control gives Moscow the impetus to flex muscles. \n1.3 Research question and objectives\nResearch Objectives:\nThe main objective of the research will to establish the impact of germany's energiewende on russo-german energy relations: a mixed-methods analysis of bilateral trade and diplomatic discourse from 2010 to 2023. \nSpecific objectives of the study will be:\nTo analyze changes in the volume and composition of German energy imports from Russia from 2010 to 2023, with a focus on how these align with Energiewende goals.\nTo examine shifts in Germany's overall energy mix during this period and assess the role of Russian energy sources within it.\nTo identify and analyze key themes and changes in diplomatic discourse between Germany and Russia regarding energy relations during the study period.\nTo evaluate the extent to which Energiewende has influenced Germany's negotiating position and priorities in energy relations with Russia.\nTo assess the broader implications of changes in Russo-German energy relations for European energy security.\n1.4 Thesis  Statement\nWith the strong energy bond that exists between Germany and Russia due to the supply of fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, the two countries’ relations have been shaped over the years. This energy dependency has probably been one of the most significant foundations of their bilateral relations, affecting not only their commercial and business relations but also their political and geopolitical strategies. However, a new challenge and a new opportunity for this relationship is presented by Germany’s ambitious Energiewende policy of transformation of the energy system with the aim of sustainability and low carbon (Sturm and Sturm, 2020). Germany aims to cut down on fossil fuel imports and integrate more renewable energy sources into the country’s energy mix; this will deeply transform the nature of the energy import relationship between it and Russia. \n Although this structural shift is important for understanding Russo-German relations, there is comparatively scarce literature that deals with the way German Energiewende has affected the volume and the composition of imported energy from Russia and the consequences of this change. The effects on European diplomatic relations, which positions may shift, and transformations that might occur to the energy security strategies are unanalyzed (Sturm, 2020). In addition, the diversification of energy supply became a strategic goal of Germany in the course of the Energiewende, but during the period of transition, Germany remained highly dependent on Russian natural gas as a sort of “interim fuel,” which distorts the intended goals of the Energiewende. \n To this end, this research aims to fill these gaps by offering a systematic analysis of the fluctuations in German energy imports from Russia, the altercations in the German energy mix between 2010 and 2023, and the transformations in the diplomatic relations between Germany and Russia in the same period. The Energy Shift intends to address different research questions such as: How has the Energiewende affected German energy policies and foreign policy approach towards Russia, and, more generally, how has it shaped European energy security? This knowledge is vital for policymakers because the outcomes will shape Germany’s energy future and bilateral Russo-German relations, as well as the security of the European energy market.\n2. Background\n2.1 Germany's Energiewende\n2.1.1 Origins and Objectives\nGermany’s Energiewende is one of the most aggressive policy processes that has been implemented to denote energy transition on a global scale. The roots of the Energiewende are most often attributed to German peoples’ awareness of the human impact on the environment, which emerged in the 1970s and 1980s because of the polluting industries, the threat of nuclear accidents, and concerns over the depletion of fossil fuel resources. This was the time when big environmental movements came to power, and the Green Party, which targeted to change the energy system in the country radically, appeared. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 also intensified the challenges against nuclear energy and, therefore, created better environmental regulation, resulting in the Energiewende. \n Thus, the main goals of the Energiewende are to decrease the emissions of greenhouse gases in Germany, remove the utilisation of nuclear power, and convert the energy system into one that relies mainly on renewable resources like wind, solar, and biomass resources. More precisely, the policy targets are a 90% cut in emissions in 2050 in comparison with the 1990 level with the intermediate targets for 2020, 2030, and 2040 (Renn and Marshall, 2020). Another goal is to reduce dependence on nuclear power, and another is to completely eliminate the use of nuclear power generation by the year 2022; this goal was set after the fateful incident at Fukushima in 2011. The Energiewende also aims to increase energy efficiency in all sectors, including industrial, commercial, transport, and household sectors, decrease primary energy demand, and ensure the availability of sufficient and cheap energy in the coming generations. \n 2.1.2 Key Policy Measures \n The Energiewende has entailed a broad spectrum of policy measures that have aimed at fostering the use of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, and phasing out nuclear and coal-fired plants over time. A feed-in tariff policy is one of the key policies: the EEG, first enacted in 2000, set feed-in tariffs for renewable energy sources (Redeker, 2024). Under the EEG, the operators were provided with a fixed price for the electricity produced by the renewable energy installations, which was still above the market price; this gave the installations a fixed revenue that spurred a very rapid expansion of wind, solar, and biomass energy.\nNevertheless, the EEG has been accompanied by a multitude of other supporting measures, such as subsidies for energy-efficient building renovations, rules for smart grids and energy storage systems, and carbon pricing. The German government has also made changes aimed at phasing out the use of coal, for example, the so-called ‘Coal Exit Law’, passed in 2019, that outlines the phases for the complete shutdown of all coal-fired power plants by the year 2038 at the latest (Huang and Han, 2022). Additionally, the Energiewende consists of actions to accommodate grid stability and energy security, upgrades of the electricity grid, regional interconnections, advanced technologies of fast-ramping power plants, and demand-side management. \n2.1.3 Timeline of Implementation \nThe Energiewende has been a long-term strategy that, in its origins, goes back to the second half of the twentieth century, while it was legally enacted during the beginning of the twenty-first century. The first large step on the roadmap was the adoption of the EEG – the German Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2000. The policy received a further boost in 2011 when the German government led by Angela Merkel opted to speed up the nuclear phase down after the incident at Fukushima (Rechsteiner, 2021). As a result of this decision, several nuclear plants were closed instantly, and the government of Germany fixed the year 2022 as the time when Germany would no longer contribute to its power supply with nuclear energy. \n In the subsequent ten years, the Energiewende led to a fast growth of installed renewable power, especially wind and photovoltaic sources. Some of the major policy changes within this period were changes on the EEG to balance feed-in tariffs and market integration and the inauguration of the Climate Action Plan 2050, which was to act as a long-term plan for Germany’s emission reduction goals (Faus and Dombrowsky, 2023). Another major achievement of the government was the ‘Coal Exit Law’ passed in 2019, which marked the onset of the gradual phasing out of coal power plants.\nThe Energiewende still persists and continues to progress as a plan for the increase of the proportion of renewable energy generation, the improvement of the efficiency of energy usage and the overcoming of the issues associated with the integration of renewables to the grid, the deployment of storage and the setting up of the appropriate markets. The policy's implementation significantly affected the German energy mix, making Germany one of the most progressive countries when it comes to renewable energy and presenting itself as an example for the rest of the world (Sturm and Sturm, 2020). \n 2.2 Historical Background of Russo-German Energy Cooperation \n The Russo-German energy relations date from the Cold War period when commercial exchanges in the sphere of energy became one of the primary aspects of their bilateral cooperation. At the onset of the 1970s, West Germany urgently sought an indigenous, efficient, and cheap source of energy and began importing natural gas from the Soviet Union. This started a symbiosis; while Germany guaranteed the constant supply of energy, the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the regular demand for the considerable and, until now, the growing potential of natural gas (Onbargi and Dombrowsky, 2023). This partnership grew stronger over the course of the decades and was bolstered by natural gas, which served as the primary foundation for Russo-German energy cooperation and influenced the energy reality of Europe as a whole. \n In the wake of the German Unity in 1990, Russia emerged as one of Germany's key energy companions, delivering a substantial quantity of natural gas that saturated Germany's industrial area as well as sent out heat to homes. This particular reliance on Russian energy persisted for years ahead, with natural gas imports at the centre of the German energy supply. The coming of the Soviet collapse did not alter this relationship; in fact, it gave new dimensions as Russia assumed the new world's role in energy supply. The German vice-foreign minister stated that 'Germany is becoming increasingly dependent on Russian gas by pinning its hope on long-term contracts and investment in infrastructure that would enable Russia to keep on supplying Germany with the needed energy resources.\n2.2.1 Overview of Energy Trade Patterns\nFor most of the two decades beginning in the previous decade and continuing until the early 2000s, both the energy trade partnership and volumes escalated, and Russia increasingly shipped natural gas and oil to Germany. By 2002, Russia accounted for 30-40 per cent of Germany’s natural gas consumption, which pointed more to the political significance of this aspect (Marangé and Stewart, 2021). This trade was not only restricted to natural gas; Russia also sold large amounts of crude oil to Germany and hence ensured its role as Germany’s chief energy partner. It was also a period of diversification of energy routes, and new pipelines are under discussion and construction to ensure the energy supply and minimize the risk presented by transit countries. \n The significance of these energy trade patterns was twofold: On the economic level, they supplied Germany with a steady and cheap source of energy that helped support the Industrial Revolution, while on the political level, they created tangled relations that affected the international politics of the two countries. However, political tensions notwithstanding, the energy trade continued to act more as a stabilizing force in Russo-German relations, and there were acknowledged benefits accrued to both the Russians and the Germans through the energy partnership. This interdependence became even more pronounced as Germany started on its Energiewende, which, although in the long run, was designed to reduce the use of fossil fuel-based energy, has, in the short term, increased the use of natural gas as a bridge fuel. \n 2.2.2 Key Agreements and Projects \n Russo-German energy cooperation has been enriched by several basic agreements and projects as far as Nord Stream pipelines are concerned. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline was launched in November 2011, and this was the flagship of the energy cooperation between Russia and Germany (Robin and Reinisch, 2023). This is a direct pipeline stretching 1,224 kilometres from Vyborg, Russia, to Greifswald, Germany, and lying underneath the Baltic Sea so as not to pass through officially recognized transit countries such as Ukraine and Poland (Ericson, 2021). Nord Stream 1 was to become an instrument to provide stable and secure supplies of Russian natural gas to Germany and other countries of the West European region with its designed annual throughput of 55 Billion cubic. It was the Russian government and a consortium of European companies led by Germany’s BASF and E. ON; the stakes were clearly economic.\nThe development of Nord Stream 2, a parallel pipeline, was planned to enhance the first route, expanding its capacity. Nord Stream 2 has been one of the most opposed pipeline projects in the last five years, with the United States and several EU countries joined by Ukraine citing that the project would only increase Europe’s reliance on Russian oil and gas and detriment the energy sectors in their countries (François-Poncet n.d). Nevertheless, Germany and Russia started the project, asserting the business sense and the requirement for a stable energy source to fuel Germany powered by the Energiewende. \n Nord Stream 2 was constructed in 2021; however, it has been the centre of geo-political controversies based on political upheavals, especially those involving Russia and Ukraine and the insecurities in the European region. The two pipelines represent Russian–German relations in the energy sector that have both benefits and risks, as they show a heavily intertwined Russian-German energy relationship. \n3. Literature Review \n3.1 Studies on the impact of Energiewende on German energy consumption\nMore specifically, the Energiewende, Germany’s energy transition policy adopted in 2010, commits to further expanding the share of renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions considerably, and eliminating nuclear power entirely. It has helped to alter Germany's energy consumption pattern and reshape its energy mix, impacted energy imports, and questioned the successes and failures that come with such a transition. \n 3.1.1 Evolution of Germany’s Energy Mix \n Several studies have looked at the effect of the Energiewende on Germany’s energy supply, especially its effectiveness in achieving a higher RE penetration by wind, solar, and biomass. The published research by Fraunhofer ISE (2022) reveals that the percentage of renewable power increased from 17% in 2010 to more than 40% in 2023. This has been realized by policy support mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs and the development of grid infrastructure, thereby reducing the use of fossil energy, predominantly coal and lignite. However, the shift has occurred unevenly across sectors. Substantial improvement in this respect is visible in the electricity market, while it is still rather low in transport and heating. Authors like Agora Energiewende (2019) believe that new policies in support of the deployment of renewables need to be introduced to meet their versatile application in the fields. Also, natural gas has been instrumental as a transition fuel, especially from Russia, to reduce the ‘carbon footprint,’ particularly in power generation and heating normally from coal. \n3.1.2 Impact on Energy Imports and Consumption Patterns\nIn terms of tangible effects on Germany’s energy imports, particularly from Russia, Energiewende has been of direct concern. Many papers have examined the role of new patterns in Germany’s energy consumption that affected its dependence on Russian imports. The change in approach to moving away from coal also saw an impressive reduction in coal imports from Russia, as seen in the tables from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin, 2020). At the same time, the demand for Russian natural gas has remained stable because of the residual basic need for heat and electricity generation, regardless of fluctuations in domestic RE generation. \nWestphal (2021) observes that despite stabilizing the share of Russian energy imports for Germany in general, this dependency has only grown where the exclusively vital forms of its Russian natural gas supplies, such as via the Nord Stream pipeline, are concerned. Issues have arisen in the literature regarding the consequences of such dependency regarding energy security and Germany’s politico-strategic orientation towards Russia. \n3.1.3 Energy Efficiency and Consumption Reduction\nThe fourth measure of the Energiewende is energy efficiency, which is aimed at decreasing the energy demand using technologies and regulations. Several papers discuss some of the major advancements Germany has made in policy targeting insulation of buildings, energy-efficient industries, and support of energy-saving technologies. Research done by the Wuppertal Institute (2018) shows that taken together, these measures have led to the slow but steady reduction of Germany’s total energy requirement even as economic production has increased; the German Energiewende is an example of the negative slope effect. \nStill, analysts continue to argue about the adequacy and the speed of such energy conservation improvements. Thomas et al. (2019) also opine that while progress has been made in the implementation of the Energiewende, the enhancement needs to be stepped up to achieve the plan's long-term objectives, especially bearing in mind the targets set for 2050. The ‘rebound effect’ whereby efficiency improvements result in higher consumption in other related areas is still a problem that is being explored to date. \n 3.1.4 Challenges and Criticisms \nHowever, Energiewende has not been without its issues, which can be looked at in detail in the literature. There is a major concern about the cost of the switch, which has unfortunately fallen squarely under the head of the electricity consumer. As for the social and economic consequences of these hikes, there is some material available; for example, BDEW (2019) is dedicated to the influence of the changes in tariffs on lower-income consumers. Furthermore, doubts as to the stability of supply, particularly when the share of renewables is low, have sometimes forced the use of extra imports of fossil fuels, including from Russia. \nThe consequences of the Energiewende scheme on foreign policy are also emerging as a subject of academic interest. While the country has progressively phased out nuclear and coal energy, the nation depends on natural gas, mainly imported from Russia, which has become a concern as the long-term reliability of such energy is due to escalating geopolitical tensions between Russia on one side and Europe on the other. This aspect of the Energiewende’s impact belongs to the literature regarding Russo-German energy relations because it captures the relationship between domestic policy-making and international politics.\n3.2 Russo-German energy diplomacy\nThe import of energy has been an integral part of Russo-German diplomacy in Europe based on economic interests, geopolitics, and diplomacy. \n3.2.1  Historical Context and Foundations \nRusso-German energy relations started in the Cold War era, and energy, especially natural gas, has been the core of their relations. Stern (2005) noted that earlier in the trend, energy trade clustered both as a buffer and as a disturbance. Certain pipeline milestones were reached in 2009 and 2012 with the construction of the Urengoy; Pomary; Uzhhorod pipeline and the Nord Stream pipeline, which placed Germany as the major transit of Russian natural gas to the Western countries. Energy writers such as Stent (2014) have agreed that these energy relations have also been win-win because Germany has secured a stable energy source while Russia has secured a ready outlet for its energy exports. Still, these relations were always a mix of conflicts and interests intertwining, resembling geopolitical conflict connected to Germany’s reliance on Russia for oil and gas and European security. \n3.2.2 The Impact of Energiewende on Bilateral Energy Trade\nThe change in Germany’s energy policy by Energiewende has brought inevitable shifts in its energy relations with Russia. One of the major goals of the Energiewende is diversification and a decrease in the dependence on the delivery of fossil energy resources, including Russian ones, in Germany. This shift has been an object of attention in the analysis of Russo-German energy relations. \nA literature review shows that similar to Westphal (2021), many works have considered the effects of declining German coal demand and the transition to diversify the energy sources on the volume and structure of Russian energy imports. As imports of coal have reduced steadily, natural gas has continued to be significant, and its importance has even been amplified as Germany shuts down nuclear and coal-fired power stations. Such has been the case due to the rather slow pace of the development of renewable energy sources, which has not been able to offset the reliance on traditional energy in the form of Russian natural gas. \nThe Nord Stream 2 pipeline project under construction is most opposed in Germany and by its allies, and the project represents the conflict between German self-sufficiency needs in the energy sector and its EU obligations and loyalty within the EU-Russia energy interdependence. Siddi (2020) notes that the German desire to be an energy turnip thrower in the larger European theatre faces hurdles when one looks at the country’s ‘Energy Turnip’ reality in Russia. \n3.2.3 Diplomatic Discourse and Energy Negotiations\nTalks between Germany and Russia concerning energy relations have changed and moved towards new dynamics, especially with the changes brought in by Energiewende. Similarly, Fischer (2019) analyzed the official German and Russian rhetorics of public diplomacy and identified the persistent focus on energy relations as the means and the goal of the management of bilateral relations in spite of geopolitical conflict. \n After the March 2014 Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the EU’s sanctions on Russia have made energy trade and investment more challenging, which could be considered as an indicator of change in Russo-German energy relations. At this time, German diplomacy more and more linked energy issues to European solidarity and energy stakes. In his article, Geden (2018) gives an insight into how Germany, an EU member state, has sought to calibrate its energy diplomacy to reflect putative EU strategic blueprints, the EU’s enthusiasm for weaning itself off Russian energy and fostering of the continental energy market integration. \n 3.2.4 Geopolitical Implications and European Energy Security\nAnother major topic of the literature is the systemic consequences of Russo–German energy cooperation for European energy security. Germany’s status as Russia’s largest customer in terms of imported energy has been a contentious issue for other European states, especially those in the CCE. For example, Smith Stegen (2015) analyzed Germany’s role in shaping the EU’s energy security vis-à-vis Russia. That is why the phenomenon of so-called ‘energy weaponization’ is often mentioned in this regard; for instance, Umbach (2018) noted that because Russia controls the supplies of energy, it possesses a crucial geopolitical advantage. Several German energy policies, including the Energiewende, are analyzed to determine how well they will improve or worsen European energy security standards. \n3.2.5 Future Prospects and Challenges \nSummary yields that the future contingencies of Russo-German energy diplomacy will not lose relevance to the pressures of Energiewende or the transformation of the international relations map. New renewable energy sources developed in Germany and the EU’s general aim to diversify from Russian energy should continue to reshape bilateral relations in the future. However, these problems persist, especially in the critical area of supply security, against the need to decrease the carbon footprint and move to a sustainable energy economy.\n3.3 Analyses of changing dynamics in European energy markets\nThe major changes in the European energy markets for the period between 2010 and 2023 are given below: The Policy of energy transition or the energiewende of Germany has effectively impacted the production, trade, and consumption of energy in Europe in a very positive way. An analysis of the existing literature on these changes shows their dynamic interaction with national energy policies, regional integration and globalization, and their contribution towards energy security and economic stability in the African continent. \n3.3.1 Integration and Liberalization of European Energy Markets\nHere, a major historical trend that has characterized the European energy markets, in particular, has been the integration and liberalization of these markets. The EU has been seeking to liberalize and integrate the energy market to intensify competition, make affordable prices, and guarantee access to supplies through transnational trade and investment in energy infrastructure. The measures that underpin these changes were introduced with the Third Energy Package introduced in 2009, which sought to unbundle energy supply and generation from the transmission networks, increase competition, and reduce the control of national monopolies. \n There has been growth in cross-border interconnectors that has enhanced the integration of the national markets, hence approving the circulation of electricity and gas within the EU member states. It has enhanced energy availability as the supply risks have been diversified, and demand/supply volatility has been optimized with the increased incorporation of renewables. For instance, energy hubs like German and Dutch energy markets have ensured that prices associated with the products are converging and harmonizing the rules of the markets to ensure that Europe’s energy markets are stronger. \n3.3.2 Impact of Renewable Energy Expansion on Market Dynamics\nThe change is best characterized as fast-paced the growth of wind and solar power, the Energiewende’s consequences have reconfigured the European energy market. These changes are due to the rising scale of renewable energy, which has caused, firstly, the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and, secondly, the reshaping of electricity markets. In the literature, one finds out that the introduction of variable renewable energy sources was taking its toll on the stability of the grid and energy pricing. \n Renewables have made electricity systems more volatile and require balancing services and flexibility reserve margin, typically with the help of open-cycle gas turbine power plants. This has enhanced the position of natural gas in European energy markets. The energy markets in Europe have continuously been supplied with natural gas from various sources. The additional generation of output, with a low marginal cost, has thus reduced the spot electricity prices through the merit order effect in which renewable sources of generation have shifted the dispatch curve downward by displacing costly sources like coal and nuclear.\nNonetheless, the price suppression has had several drawbacks: it resulted in decreased profitability for standard power plants, but those are still necessary to guarantee dependable power provision throughout weak renewable hours. This has raised questions on the future suitability of these structures and the emergence of new pricing models that will put adequate value on capacity and flexibility in a heavily renewed power market. \n3.3.3 Geopolitical Shifts and Energy Security Concerns\nNew dynamics in European energy markets are closely linked to the geo-political processes, especially in terms of energy security. The Russian infringement of Ukraine’s territorial integrity through the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014 gave a breakthrough in European energy policy through the EU sanctions. These events exposed Europe to the vulnerability of relying on Russian energy, especially natural gas, making strategies for energy security in the continent to be reviewed. \n In response to such threats, the EU has endeavored to diversify the sources and the routes of energy supply, and some of the measures that have been undertaken include the construction of new LNG terminals and the increasing of pipeline infrastructure that links it with other suppliers such as Norway, Azerbaijan, and the United States. Such programs as the Energy Union involve collective energy security enhancement through enhanced cooperation and management of crises among EU countries. \n Some of these geo-political shifts have been a result of Germany’s Energiewende. The coal and nuclear energy phase-out has boosted Russia’s gas exports to Germany, especially through pipelines such as Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2. This very dependence has been a source of conflict in the EU as it could open the bloc to political pressure from Russia, most especially during geo-political crises. \n3.3.4 Role of Market Reforms and Policy Initiatives\nThe literature also discusses the changes that occur in such a transition and the effects of market reforms and policies on them. The Clean Energy for All Europeans package agreed in 2018 is another important structure that has advanced both the market integration and the share of renewables and the energy efficiency in the EU. This package laid down new market rules for what became known as capacity mechanisms to address the security of supply in a market that was rapidly transforming into one based on renewables, as well as rules for enabling consumers and demand side management for grid balancing. \n These reforms are important to help achieve changes to the existing energy systems while preserving the balance and stability of the markets. The EU market’s further evolution and increased cooperation between the institutions will be necessary to address the challenges coming with a higher share of RES, the need for balancing capacities, and the uncertainty of geopolitics in terms of energy sources.\n3.4 Gaps in existing literature\nSeveral gaps can be defined in the current literature, where further studies could be useful. First, there is relatively limited evidence relating to energy efficiency by sector. Other reviews, for example, the Wuppertal Institute’s recent analysis of progress toward RE in Germany (2018) or Thomas and others’ discussion of Germany’s progress toward its energy efficiency goals (2019), do reference progress in the relevant areas of energy efficiency. Still, their emphasis is on building insulation and industrial efficiency. This has created a void in the current coverage of energy efficiency in transport and residential heating, which are so crucial in the broader agenda of cutting down energy consumption. Greater analysis of energy efficiency in all relevant areas, including transportation and heating, might give a broader picture of the overall situation with energy efficiency in Germany and would potentially help to trace particular problems more clearly. \nSecond, the current literature provides a very limited understanding of the so-called ‘rebound effect’, suggesting that improving efficiency in one sector increases demand in another. While the idea is occasionally discussed by Thomas et al. (2019), the literature analyzing the rebound effect regarding the German transition is still relatively limited and lacks many specific measurements. Subsequent studies could aim to identify the behaviour of the rebound effect concerning various industries and develop pragmatic measures for avoiding increased energy consumption that occurs due to increased efficiency. \nThird, analysing the energy relations between EU member states and Russia, specifically in natural gas, lacks considerable work after 2014. Although materials, including Westphal (2021) and Umbach (2018), address Germany’s energy importation from Russia, most of this literature exists before the major breaches in relations like the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. With the shift in the international structure, energy relations between Germany and Russia must be reviewed and assessed. Published work could assess this dependency given recent changes in the geopolitical landscape and new energy scenarios that could be applied to decrease German dependency on Russian supplies.\nThe lack of prior research is the second shortcoming: insufficient attention is paid to the social and economic impact of the energy transition. While the social impacts of Energiewende, especially regarding the electricity tariffs, are discussed by BDEW (2019), there is some dearth of research on the subject dealing with Energiewende in general. This encompasses their impacts on shift working, regional distribution, and the level of populace approval for renewable power projects. For the next steps of the research, the author could investigate the socioeconomic effects of Energiewende – whether it benefits or harms particular social groups, regions, or industries and what should be done to avoid negative consequences. \n Besides, the literature lacks research work on the sustainability of natural gas as a transition fuel in the long run. The extant literature, including Agora Energiewende (2019) and Siddi (2020), has reported on natural gas as a transition fuel. However, few have addressed sustainability, especially given the push for full sector decarbonization by 2050. Further analysis is required regarding the continued role of natural gas in the German mix and its potential to facilitate the country’s transition to the net-zero regime. It may examine other sources of energy apart from natural gas and the consequences of reducing resource utilization. \nFinally, the shifts in the geopolitical landscape, which are likely to be triggered by Energiewende, have not received adequate attention in the literature. Although several sources cover the geopolitical factors of Germany’s energy policy (Fischer, 2019; Geden, 2018), there is insufficient coverage regarding how these processes will develop over time in response to recent changes in policy and world events. Another topic that has not been examined is the peculiarities of Germany’s position in the European energy security system. Further research could focus on exploring the shifts in the geopolitical environment, including the positioning of Germany and its impact on the European energy systems and interaction with other major energy providers in the frame of the EU Green Deal and others. In conclusion, the current knowledge base is well-developed. However, several gaps have to be investigated to respond to new threats and prospects connected to the intrinsically changing nature of the renewable energy transition in Germany and its impacts on global energy security and regulatory policies.\n4. Theoretical Framework\n4.1 Energy transition theory\nEnergy Transition Theory is fundamental to grasping the profound transformations of the energy systems at various sociotechnical scales and, with specific regard to Germany's Energiewende, has altered Russo-German energy relations, as analyzed between 2010 and 2023. This theory depicts the change process from reliance on more traditional and conventional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, to more modern and sustainable sources of energy, such as renewable energy sources (Doh et al., 2021). It is a technological, economic, and socio-political concept that is centered on the transformation of energy infrastructure systems where old energy structures are progressively replaced by new, cleaner structures. \n Out of all the case studies, Germany's energy transition policy, known as Energiewende, is one of the most vivid examples of the Energy Transition Theory in action. It aims to cut down the emission of greenhouse gases to almost anything and tilt the energy balance in favor of wind and solar energy. This transition, which has occurred recently, has not only brought drastic changes in Germany's internal electricity mix but has also had international implications, especially in Germany's bilateral relations with Russia, the major source of oil and natural gas for the continent (Wilkinson et al., 2021). \n The theory focuses on the multiple stages of transforming energies that start with invention and then continue with market-specific implementation, up to the point where the new energies take over (Roemer & Haggerty, 2022). In Germany's case, this shift has been realized by decreasing its dependence on coal and nuclear energy and increasing its reliance on natural gas, although most of which is imported from Russia, as well as on renewable energy sources (Dragomir et al., 2023). The balance between these energy kinds within the German energy portfolio is known as the specific subject matter of Energy Transition Theory. \n 4.2 International Relation theories that apply to energy Diplomacy \nInternational relations theories can be used as a theoretical framework in which to understand the dynamics of Germany's energy transition and its energy relations with Russia between 2010 and 2023. There are two prominent IR theories that can help to explain the situation of Russo–German energy relations in the mentioned period – Realism and Liberalism.\nRealism: Realism locates power national interest supplemented by the system's structure as its constitutive basis for examining energy diplomacy as a strategy. Using the Realist's lens, Germany's dependence on Russian energy, especially natural gas, is considered a strategic weakness. This dependence puts Russia in a very strong position, in theory allowing it to manipulate German and, more generally, European policy if it so wishes (Sørensen et al., 2022). Realists would posit that Germany's energy policies, particularly the Energiewende, have to be seen in line with the national security perspective, where dependence on Russia-controlled energy resources threatens Germany and the entire Europe. These arguments can be illustrated by the current discussions about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, as this project is viewed by many as deepening the EU's long-term reliance on Russia's energy resources.\nLiberalism: At the same time, Liberalism advocates integration, dependency, and the part of the international organizations and institutions in avoiding war. In this regard, the Liberal point of view does not portray the German-Russian energy connection as a power game that can lead to an energy race; rather, it is more of a trade relation that if properly managed will contribute to the shaping of a coercive peace (Qin, 2020). Germany has achieved a certain degree of success in the Energiewende in reducing dependence on fossil fuels, especially coal, but Russia's importance for its gas has not diminished (Warner & de Man, 2020). In line with Liberalism's approach to international relations, this entangled interdependence, coupled with diplomacy as well as membership in international organizations such as the EU, pave the way for more predictable and positive energy relations notwithstanding tensions. The ever-present talks and bargaining sessions between Germany and Russia in energy-related matters can well be ascribed to the liberal tenets of IR laid down above. \n4.3 Conceptual Model for the Analysis of Bilateral Energy Relations \n First, one has to understand the Energiewende as a process of energy transition in Germany and combine this perspective with components of international relations and economic interdependence in order to create a suitable conceptual model for the analysis of the influence of that change on the Russo-German relations from 2010 to 2023. This model should describe these bilateral energy relationships using such forms of entertainment as changes in policies, economic interdependence, and geopolitical and diplomatic talk.\nEnergy Transition and Policy Alignment: This model has, at its heart, the German model of Energiewende to make the transition to renewable sources of energy and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The model analyses how these policy changes affected the overall structure of energy import into Germany from Russia, focusing on natural gas, coal, and oil (Zhao et al., 2022). The cases discuss the extent to which Energiewende's goals are coherent with or contradictory to the continued dependence of Germany on Russian energy, possible tensions between national energy policy objectives, and international trade conditions. \nEconomic Interdependence and Trade Dynamics: The second important aspect hypothesized in this model is that Germany and Russia depend economically on each other. It is centered on the trade balance on energy products and how shifts within these trade flows can be attributed to German energy consumption portfolio changes. It also evaluates how Russia's energy export to Germany helps stabilize and strengthen Russia's economy and geopolitical power (Shepard & Pratson, 2020). Using trade matrices, the volume-imports impact ratio is analyzed, and the effect on the economy of both nations is inferred as the quantitative framework of the energy relationship model. \nGeopolitical and Diplomatic Dimensions: The third dimension of the model takes account of the geopolitical context, more specifically, how the geopolitics of the region and the world influences the energy relations between Germany Russiaorld (Sattich et al., 2021). The external factor in the approach is the international events affecting energy diplomacy by sanctions and conflict. It also looks at the part played by diplomatic language, examining semantic themes peculiar to the Germany-Russia energy dialogue and the pairs of statements and declarations to determine the status of energy dependence in both partners' foreign policies. \nEuropean Energy Security Considerations: Last, the model positions Russo-German energy cooperation in the framework of the EU energy security. It assesses how Germany's decisions concerning energy affect the EU as a whole in terms of the EU's discoursed energy policies, such as diversification of supply and unification of energy markets (Dooyum et al., 2020). This part of the model deals with such issues as risks associated with Germany's dependence on Russian natural gas and oil and the security of such supply. \n5. Methodology\n5.1. Mixed-methods approach\nTo meet research aims and answer the research questions on the influence of the German energy transition policy on Russo-German energy relations, quantitative and qualitative analysis methods are used, incorporating energy trade statistical data along with diplomatic rhetoric. This dual perspective enables a depth and richness that more conventional approaches to analyzing the relations between energy policy, trade, and diplomatic relations cannot provide. \n 5.1.1. Quantitative Analysis of Trade Data\nThe quantitative component examines the fluctuations in the total and structural German-Russian import of energy from 2010‒2023. Data from the Eurostat, IEA, and the Federal Statistical Office of Germany will be applied for this analysis. Areas to look at will consist of the quantity of natural gas, oil, and coal imports, how many of these imports are used in Germany's energy mix, and how these imports meet the goals of the Energiewende like reduced use of fossil fuels and higher use of renewable energy. \n5.1.2. Qualitative Analysis of Diplomatic Discourse \nThe qualitative aspect of the work consists of a comprehensive analysis of the diplomatic debate between Germany and Russia during the same period. This will involve the study of pronouncements, discourses, and policy briefs from the two governments in question, as well as newspaper and electronic media accounts and commentaries. The main objective should be analyzing the kinds of issues, changes in discursive practices, and strategic directions that can indicate the transformation of energy relations.Techniques like content analysis and thematic analysis of the text will be used to systematically categorize the discourse's content. \n5.2. Data sources and collection methods\nTo achieve an efficient combination of methods and data sources, this study will employ both quantitative and qualitative data sources to substantiate the findings related to trade patterns and diplomatic relations. \nQuantitative Data Sources: The primary quantitative data will be collected from reliable cross-sectional and sectional international and national databases such as: Eurostat and International Energy Agency (IEA \nInformation concerning imports will be gathered from 2010 to 2023, including the annual imports, split by energy type, and the distribution of Russian energy in the total energy consumption in Germany. This data will be analyzed to find trends, highs and lows.\nQualitative Data Sources: The qualitative collection will include diplomatic discourse from the following sources: Government Documents and Statements, Media Reports,and International Organizations. Data will thus be gathered systematically through archival research, databases, and the media. \n5.3. Analytical techniques\nTo comprehensively address the research objectives, this study will employ two primary analytical techniques: convenience sampling, where quantitative analysis is used on time series on trading data, and qualitative analysis, which is used on the content of diplomatic statements.\n5.3.1. Time Series Analysis for Trade Data\nThe volume and composition of German energy imports from Russia shall be tested for variability with the application of time series analysis. This technique is particularly useful for the analysis of time series data.\nData Preparation: The trade data will include Annual datasets organized from major sources such as Eurostat and IEA that illustrate the volumes of imports and energy types, including natural gas, oil, and coal imported from Russia. \nTrend Analysis: Remaining focused on the interannual dynamics will allow for evaluating the long-term tendencies in the number of energy imports from Russia, the transformation of the types of energy, and the calendar moments of intense changes;  all in regard to the key milestones of the Energiewende. \n5.3.2. Content Analysis for Diplomatic Statements\nContent analysis will be used to analyze and make conclusions concerning the diplomatic communication between Germany and Russia concerning energy issues. By this method, it becomes easy to determine both long-standing trends in the tone of the discourse, as well as fluctuations in the way that energy issues are positioned within the overall context of the Germany-Russia bilateral relations. \n 5.4. Limitations and potential biases\nThe quantitative and qualitative analysis employed in the study gives an exhaustive account of the effects of Germany’s Energiewende on Russo-German energy relations, but below are the drawbacks and potential biases inherent in the study. One important limitation is the data issue, especially the lack of high-quality data in trades and diplomatic relations, which may cause fluctuation and blank data. Furthermore, analysis of diplomatic language is in part based on personal impression, which means that themes may be emphasized in a biased manner due to the fact that diplomatic language is often raised to a specific level of abstractness. \nProving causality specifically relating to the effects of the Energiewende on the alteration of energy trade flows also becomes difficult because many factors outside the reforms themselves can affect the flows of energy within the global economy. Another factor contributing to these challenges is related to the specifics of the investigated problems in the sphere of geopolitics, which are regarded as very sensitive at the present stage, and the changing dynamics of Russo-German relations. Finally, the study and its results have their limitations: they reflect the Russo-German experience and might not apply to other countries to the extent. \n6. Quantitative Analysis: Trends in Russo-German Energy Trade\n6.1 Changes in volume and composition of energy imports from Russia\nFigure 1:Imports of Natural Gas by Germany\nSource: (Eurostat, 2023)\n\nFigure 2:Germany Import Composition (2000-2022)\n\nSource: Author\n\nCrude oil importation into the country reduced from 3,964,356 TJ in 2010 to 3,455,486 TJ in 2021 and then increased to 3,747,623 TJ in 2022. A significant reduction can be observed from 2009-2011, probably because of the financial crisis, and, generally, this trend was observed until 2021. Since 2014, however, the decline has been less steep, indicating a gradual process of energy diversification away from Russian crude oil. \n On the other hand, natural gas imports showed some volatility during this period. The volume of imports rose gradually from 3,299,292 TJ in 2010 to the maximum level of 4,008,493 TJ in 2017 and reduced to 2,958,959 TJ in 2022. The largest increase between 2015/2017 is possibly due to increased natural gas consumption in the global market. However, it started a decline after 2017 due to the change in geopolitical situation and energy policies due to the changes in the supply mix. Despite the deterioration of political relations since 2014, natural gas purchases continued to be rather high until 2017 and have declined subsequently. \n Coal imports also showed variation and went higher to 1,364,347 TJ in 2010, reaching a level of 1,660,701 TJ in 2016 and coming down to 1,257,914 TJ in 2022. The volume of coal imports has been gradually growing from 2010 to 2016; however, it has declined since 2016. This decline is synchronized with Germany’s Energiewende policy that seeks to decrease coal use and shift to cleaner energy services. While there was a short-term ‘rebound effect’ in which the import of coal increased in the post-2014 period, a long-term trend points to the fact that the future of energy in Germany beyond 2020 is not coal but rather one that is part of the transition process to a sustainable energy future.\n6.2. Impact on Germany's energy mix\nGermany’s transit and consumption of imported energy, especially from Russia, added further dynamics in changes in the country’s energy mix about the energy transformation plan called the Energiewende. This policy, which seeks to limit the levels of greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging the use of clean energy sources, has caused changes in the kinds and quantities of energy imported from Russia in recent years. \n 6.2.1. Decline in Fossil Fuels: \nAn evident change in the structure of energy imports in Germany was observed after 2014, and even crude oil and coal imports, which have been gradually declining, should be attributed to the change in strategy. Due to the desire to decrease carbon emissions, Germany has, in the process, scaled down the use of coal, one of the significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions. It can be observed that the imports of coal started to decrease in 2016 and have a continuous descension, which is Germany’s effort to phase out the usage of coal-fired power plants and turn to the utilization of renewable energy for electricity production. Likewise, the fall in crude oil imports indicates the diversification of energy sources, and the progressive reduction in the use of oil in Germany’s energy supply is an important but decreasing substrate. \n 6.2.2. Natural Gas as a Transitional Fuel\n In the case of Germany, natural gas has played a rather intricate part in the energy palette. On the other hand, natural gas imports after the Crimea crisis augmented and achieved their maximum in the year 2017 and then started to decline. This can be explained by the attempts of Germany to satisfy its need for a stable and, compared to coal, less dirty fossil fuel while avoiding the risks connected with the import of natural gas from Russia. Natural gas has thus been envisioned as a transition fuel in Germany, which is on its way to divest from coal and transition to renewable energy sources. However, the trends have reversed recently, and the young conflict between Russia and Ukraine is evident in the problems and risks associated with dependency. Germany has recently started a process of trying to cut the use of natural gas due to external political pressure and to improve energy security.\n6.2.3. Rise of Renewables\nThis, together with the increasing import of fossil fuel, has been matched with Germany’s shift towards renewable energy. While the paper's observation is based on the changes in figures of crude oil, natural gas, and coal imports, the decline in the total amount of these sources indicates the increases in the share of renewable energy sources. The Energiewende has led to the enhancement of investment in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Therefore, renewable energy sources have gained a foothold in the processes of electricity generation, heating, and other sections traditionally dominated by fossil resources. \n6.2.4 Energy Security and Diversification \nThe conflict between Russia and Germany, particularly since 2014 and the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict, has exposed Germany to the need to re-strategize energy security. Thanks to the reduced Russian energy imports, Germany has been forced to look for other energy sources and increase investment in the domestic production of Renewable energy. This change minimizes Germany’s exposure to geopolitical threats in neighboring countries and benefits the country’s green agenda. \n6.3. Comparative analysis with other European countries\n\nA comparative analysis of Germany’s Natural Gas imports from Russia against that of other European nations (France, Italy, Poland, and the UK) shows the energy policies these countries have engraved for themselves as influenced by global events and policy shifts. \nOf all the European countries described here, Germany has always imported much larger quantities of natural gas from Russia. For example, in 2010, the import figure was about 33,996 million cubic meters of natural gas, of which Germany had the highest importation figure, followed by France with 7,524 million cubic meters, Italy importing 14,964 million cubic meters, and Poland with 9,756 million cubic meters. The general trend of increase is observed throughout the period, and taking the circle of most recently available estimations, Germany’s imports in this segment reached 62,079 million cubic meters in 2017.\nTrends Over Time \nGermany: The volume imported has periodically varied, with the highest level of import recorded during the year 2017 and slightly decreased after that. This decrease became sharp in 2022, at 25,941 million cubic meters on average for the country. The fall is also due to the geopolitical risk factors stemming from the Russia-Ukraine situation, coupled with Germany's efforts towards an energy transition strategy and phasing out the reliance on Russia's gas supplies. \nFrance and Italy: It can be seen that both countries, compared with Germany, exhibit a different form. France's imports were much lower and varied only slightly, declining from 10,542.064 million cubic meters in 2019 to 8,437.921 million in 2022. The same can be said about imports – they also reached the maximum in Italy in 2017 and declined further in the following years;– this trend can be observed for most European countries, aimed to decrease their dependence on Russia as a gas supplier after 2017. \nPoland: From 2010 to 2021, the gross imports of Poland fluctuated with a general slight tendency to increase, but in 2022, the imports reduced and constituted 2986.300 million cubic meters. Poland has been quite active within the EU in diversifying its supply sources. It mixes with an emphasis on cutting its dependency on Russian natural gas through new LNG regasification terminals. \nUnited Kingdom: More to the point, the UK's dependence on Russian natural gas is virtually nonexistent: there were no Russian pipeline gas imports before 2017, and even in 2017, the volumes imported were significantly lower than those imported by some other countries. This shows that the UK has better energy security and a variety of supply sources from which it imports its energy, e.g., North Sea gas. \n7. Qualitative Analysis: Shifts in Diplomatic Discourse\n7.1 Evolution of official statements and policy documents\nOfficial statements and policy papers regarding Russo-German energy relations have been developed as sub-chilling the ardor of the 2010s only to resurrect it anew in the wake of Germany's energiewende and shifting geopolitics through to 2023. From the beginning of the 2010s, official statements of Germany have seen Russia as a strategic partner in the sphere of energy security in Germany and a reliable supplier of natural gas in particular (German Energy Concept, 2010). Even the policy documents of this period discussing the move to renewables, for instance, the German Energy Concept of 2010, while setting impressive targets for the use of clean energy sources, underlined the importance of natural gas as a transition fuel, thus, indirectly, justifying Russian hydrocarbon supplies.\nIn particular, after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, there was a shift in the rhetoric of German foreign policy. The government’s formal declarations began to focus more on energy security issues and the search for alternative sources of supply. The Energiewende became increasingly ‘sold’ not only as an environmental program but as a security policy necessity to diversify away from Russian energy imports (EU Energy Security Strategy, 2014). During this period, the German government called for more European energy independence, which was reflected in various policy documents such as the 2015 Energy Security Strategy, which decreased the dependence on specific suppliers and strengthened the energy infrastructure, including the one for the non-conventional types of energy, was mentioned (Energy Security Strategy, 2015). \nThe years before and after the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 saw a major escalation of this assertiveness. During the German energy turn, policy papers and official statements were marked by a singularly acute discursive construction of energy diversification. Such a change in the tone can be observed in the declarations of Chancellor Olaf Scholz in 2022 when he proclaimed a shift in the German energy policy and the desire to stop buying ‘Russian energy. Such statements were followed by actual policy initiatives like renewing renewables and building LNG as an alternative to Russian gas. \n7.2 Analysis of bilateral meetings and negotiations\nBased on the information on the bilateral meetings and negotiations between Germany and Russia in the course of 2010-2023, it can be stated that both the tone and substance of the interaction processes have changed several times; first, due to the events in the sphere of German energy policy and the second, due to general tendencies in both states’ foreign policies. In the early part of the decade, many bilateral sessions would provide information about increasing the two states’ close energy relationship (Westphal, 2021). These were sensible discussions, with both parties putting weight on the gains resulting from energy trade. Germany, which depends on Russian natural gas, favored reliability in those negotiations and focused on huge and prolonged contracts. These talks focused on the Nord Stream pipeline projects, especially on NS 2, which was an emblem of enhancing energy cooperation between the two countries.\nHowever, the ‘‘hybrid’’ war that started in Ukraine after the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 abruptly changed this modality of bilateral relations. The subsequent sessions of the meetings and negotiations, which followed the adoption of the August plan, were relatively tense and, at times, confrontational (Umbach, 2018). Thus, Germany, remaining an active participant in interaction with Russia in the sphere of energy cooperation, started to express concerns connected with energy security and, in particular, possible dependence on the sole supplier. During this period, the diplomates’ approach could be described as Janus-faced: Germany cooperated with Russia in the sphere of energy and advocated for the EU’s sanctions. At the same time,  advocated for the EU’s sanctions at the same time as it called for more diversification of energy sources within Europe. Such a combined strategy, more often than not, puts pressure on the actors, particularly as it concerns the fate of the Nord Stream 2 project, which emerged as an emblematic project in Germany’s internal and external affairs. \n The Russian-Ukrainian relations were repudiated in early 2020 but sharpened up in February 2022 by the invasion of Russian troops which radically changed the dynamics of bilateral relations and their bargaining processes. The orientation of the German high-level talks became more pragmatic, and the emphasis was placed on the attempts to weaken the influence of Russian raw materials on the German economy (Fischer, 2019). The tenor of the negotiations became more hostile after Germany signaled cooperation with the broader Western attempts at the isolation of Russia in terms of economics and politics. Many initiatives were launched with the aim of searching for new sources of energy and furthering Germany’s Energiewende; at the same time, bilateral energy talks with Russia became more hostile and utilitarian (Geden, 2018). The dynamics of these negotiations reveal long-term social, political, and economic changes – reflecting the global reconfiguration of power and the Schlieffen transformation of the German and the Russian Energy sectors. \n7.3 Media representation of Russo-German energy relations\nThe case of Russo-German energy relations between the years 2010 and 2023 has been critically scrutinized with the help of an analysis of the media representation. As will be illustrated based on a selection of articles in German and Russian media from the early 2010s, the energy partnership was depicted as symbiotic, essential for both parties. Both Der Spiegel and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung more frequently positioned the relationship in terms of economic benefits in terms of stable natural gas supplies from Russia as Germany’s energy security imperative, especially during the period of transition to the Energiewende. The same view was expressed by Russian media, including Kommersant and TASS, which stressed the stability of Russia as a supplier of energy to Europe and the significance of both the Nord Stream pipeline projects.\nHowever, with the Ukrainian crisis in 2014 and the annexation of Crimea, it was observed that there were changes in the media's discursive practices. More attention was paid to the prospects for developing Russian energy supplies for Germany as the media observed the political risks of such cooperation (Financial Times, 2022). They were perhaps based on the contradiction between economic gain and the ethical dilemma of preserving friendly business relations with an energy partner, which was seen as gradually becoming belligerent in the international arena. The conflict related to the construction of Nord Stream 2 intensified specifically in the German media, where it became a sort of embodiment of the conflict between energy security on the one hand and solidarity towards Russia's actions on the other (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 2010-2023). During this period, there were more articles and opinion pieces for the diversification of energy sources and more blame on the German government for being lethargic towards the increasing Russian influence in this sector. \n During the middle of 2022, the coverage of the Russia and Ukraine wars increased and shifted towards extreme polarity (TASS, 2010-2023). Thus, more and more publications in German media turned the energy relations with Russia into a problem stressing the necessity to break liberated from Russian energy and transition to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible (Der Spiegel, 2010-2023). In contrast, the Russian media depicted Germany's actions as a part of a general Western plan to deliver a blow to Russia's economy and Germany as a country simply following the United States' orders. The striking contrast between these two media narratives exposes the growing gap in Russo-German relations concerning energy. It reveals the general shifts of geopolitical nature occurring in the latter half of the 2000s. \n8. Discussion\n8.1 Synthesis of quantitative and qualitative findings\nFrom 2010 to 2014, the importation of crude oil reduced, as was the importation of natural gas, with coal being imported nearly uniformly. What is noteworthy about this pre-Crimea annexation era is that figures have been gradually fluctuating slightly above or below these levels. All in all, energy trade throughout these years was not characterized, perhaps, by radical fluctuations. It can be labeled much more stable compared to the previous decade, which shows how predictable the cooperation between Germany and Russia has become.\nHowever, from 2014 to 2022, changes started to be recorded regarding the energy trade. Natural gas imports rose for the first time after the Crimean annexation; they again started falling from 2017 onwards. Several geopolitical factors and the change in the German focus on renewable energy owing to the Energiewende policy may have contributed to this reduction. At the same time, Germany's crude oil imports, in particular those to be used as a fuel, have gradually declined. In contrast, the figures for coal imports, especially those since 2016, have followed a similar trend in line with Germany's broader transition to reduce its use of fossil fuels. \nUntil 2022 and up to the first half of 2023, the data shows Germany's action toward the heightened Russia-Ukraine conflict. Due to Germany's commitment to the energy transition, there was a significant reduction in both the natural gas and crude oil imports from Russia. This was not only because of the geopolitics created by the war but also because of Germany's desire to go forward with the Energiewende policy, which seeks to diminish the importation of energy from Russia and promote the use of renewable energy. \n8.2 Implications for future Russo-German energy relations\nThe consequences of future Russo-German energy relations in the energy import-export realm are vast in quantity and quality due to the changes in diplomatic and discursive strategies. Thus, developing a new strategy for relations with Russia, aside from the initiatives resulting from the Energiewende and efforts to decrease critically important gas imports from Russia to below 50 percent, Germany will experience further changes like this interaction. \nPerhaps the most profound consequence is that the German energy market will probably unplug itself from dependence on Russian resources. The trend in the importation of natural gas, crude oil, and coal from Russia from 2018 to 20212 has been constantly reducing even before the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and more intensely from the early months of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022. To this extent, it is likely to intensify as Germany adds more renewable energy into its energy mix, making Russia a less dominant player in Germany and the EU.\nPolitically, as a result of this change, a deterioration of the relations between the two countries might occur. The work also uses qualitative data to indicate how energy has been one of the most important factors in Russo-German relations, with energy being used to stabilize relations despite political tensions. Nonetheless, the diplomatic relationship will likely sour with Germany moving away from Russian energy. Another focal point of conflict might emerge from the German effort to adhere to longer European and NATO strategies to minimize the reliance on Russian energy to meet its demands, for which the EU, in its recent efforts, would want to create a more independent and diverse energy system. \n8.3. Broader impact on European energy security\nHungary’s gas consumption crisis might be a relatively limited problem compared to the broader phenomenon of transforming Russo-German relations and the potential effects of this shift on European security and the future of energy provision on the continent. When Germany, which belongs to the largest economies of the EU, starts ahead to free itself from Russian energy resources, this change may have an impact. This simply changes policy, supply, and geopolitical affiliations across Europe. \nOne of the more observable effects is the call for more energy source diversification in the EU. Thanks to the Energiewende policy and political and military crises like the warfare between Russia and Ukraine, Germany has reduced its reliance on Russian natural gas, crude oil, and coal imports, which, in turn, has forced other EU countries to think about their relationships with Russia as well. This shift is expected to result in more investment in other energy sources, such as renewable sources, nuclear energy, and the importation of LNG from other politically stable countries. Efforts to diversify such supplies are important for improving Europe's energy security and minimizing risks concerning supply disruptions and the consequent geopolitical risks related to dependence on a single supplier.\nModifying energy supply routes is also one of the factors that creates a more extensive sense of impact. Germany and several other EU countries are now diversifying their energy supply, which is why new facilities, including LNG terminals and interconnectors, are being constructed. These infrastructure developments assured energy security and simultaneously promoted energy cooperation within EU membership, where the members can share resources and overcome such supply problems. \n9. Conclusion\n9.1 Summary of key findings\nThe research identified Several trends on the interaction between Germany’s Energiewende and the country’s energy trade with Russia from 2010 to 2023, including the following. Calculations made with the help of quantitative methods also indicated a change in the amount and nature of imported energy from Russia, especially after the Ukraine crisis, including the Crimean crisis. Analyzing the results, it was possible to state that the German increasing focus on renewable power sources mentioned in the objectives of the Energiewende led to the gradual reduction of the country’s dependence on Russian FS, especially natural gas and crude oil. The discourse analysis of the diplomatic and media texts has revealed dynamic stories of the Russo-German energy relations that captured the struggle for energy security with political aspects. Altogether, these conclusions can give a holistic picture of how the German energy policies have transformed the country’s relations with Russia in the last ten years. \n9.2 Theoretical and policy implications\nFrom this point of view, this research complements the more general discussion on energy security and international relations by demonstrating that domestic socio-political measures such as the Energiewende may determine a country's foreign energy policy. The transition trend from the Russian energy supplies reveals the nature of national policies alongside the international relations for energy trade. In terms of public policy, therefore, extant literature posits Germany’s democratization of renewable energy as having equally profound implications for the country’s energy mix and its geopolitical stand. The EU energy diversification from Russia may offer an example to other European countries as they strive to reduce the energy risks associated with politicizing energy resources. Future policymakers can learn much from Germany’s approach to diversifying energy sources and dependence on external political manipulations. \n 9.3. Suggestions for future research\nFurther research could build on this work to examine whether the perceived threats and consequences of Germany’s Energiewende are also likely to have enduring effects on its more extensive relationship with the other powerful energy suppliers. However, another level of comparison that may be useful would be the comparison with other European countries that have gone through a similar shift of their energy mix to gain a higher understanding of policy efficiency at a regional level. Future qualitative research could also explore the rhetorics of energy self-sufficiency and environmental responsibility in various political regimes to understand how these metaphors influence people and policies. Lastly, discussing the potential of relatively new technologies, like green hydrogen, for the future development of Russo-German energy relations may open the space for predicting future trends in energy diplomacy in Europe.", 'Critical Evaluation of MBP134, A Mix of Two Pan-Ebolavirus mAbs\nBackground \nThe article by Kuang et al. (2022) details the findings of a study conducted to establish the efficacy of MBP134, a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies in the management of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Some of the key symptoms associated with the disease include fever, gastrointestinal problems, and multiple organ dysfunction (Jacob et al., 2020). According to the WHO, Ebola is a rare but severe syndrome in humans, with an average fatality rate of 50%. However, the WHO further reported variations in case fatality rates that could range from 25% to 90% in some strains (WHO, 2023). The global health body indicates that early interventions including administration of some monoclonal antibodies could help to contain the disease. According to Hussein (2023), the first case of EVD was reported in the now DRC in 1976, with subsequent outbreaks resulting in the isolation and characterization of six strains of the virus associated with the zoonotic disease in humans another primates. Studies also suggest that bats are the principal reservoir hosts, with both human-wildlife interactions and human-human contact critical for the spread of the virus and hence the EVD (Hussein, 2023). To this end, both the WHO and researchers advocate for a one health approach anchored on a comprehensive understanding of the origin of the disease, surveillance across sectors for signs of the disease, community engagement, and environmental monitoring to contain potential outbreaks. Moreover, efforts to develop effective vaccines for the disease will be key in tackling future outbreaks. \nDrug Development \nAccording to Kuang et al. (2022), developing potent treatments for highly infectious viruses isa key priority for the global community, particularly in the wake of EVD epidemics and the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers also shared that WHO has since approved two monoclonal antibody treatments for Ebola. While these approved vaccines were effective against Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) strain, their efficacy against the remaining five species of ebolaviruses was poor thus necessitating alternative immunotherapeutic approaches. This concern was consistent with the observations of Tshiani Mbaya et al. (2021) on the efficacy of the FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, reporting 35.1% and 33.5% mortality rates for EVD patients receiving mAb114 and REGN-EB3 respectively. Therefore, the alternative cocktail of mAbs proposed by Kuang et al. (2022) would target highly conserved non-overlapping epitopes associated with the ebolavirus glycoprotein. To achieve this targeted inhibitory effect, the study by Kuang et al. (2022) involved developing a cocktail of two mAbs ADI-15878 and ADI-23774. The choice of the noncompeting pair not only helps to maintain the potency of the antibodies by preventing potential antibody antagonism but also maximizes target coverage. This approach to developing antibody cocktails has proven effective on the SARS-Cov-2 in which the non-competing mAb pair successfully blocked the Covid-19 virus from binding to ACE2 receptor (Wu et al., 2020). \nFurther, the development of the antibody cocktail could also result in a synergistic effect, resulting in better treatment outcomes. The approach is also consistent with the concept of vaccine mixing that was clinically tested during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a study by Palanica and Jeon (2022), for instance, the researchers observed that getting two doses of heterologous vaccines resulted in increased immune response compared to receiving two homologous doses. On the same note, the development of the MBP134 cocktail is premised on the synergistic effects of multiple antibodies, making the drug a potentially effective way to reduce the likelihood of selection of resistant viruses, ensuring little drug resistance.\nBy targeting the highly conserved non-overlapping regions of the ebolavirus glycoprotein, MBP134 can be effective against the other variants of ebolavirus that the monotherapies might not address. The mAb cocktail exploits the mechanisms of action behind each of ADI-15878 and ADI-23774, both acting by inhibiting the GP-mediated fusion of the ebolavirus on the membrane of the target host cells. The assays on the efficacy of the pan-ebolavirus indicated that it is an effective post-exposure prophylactic for individuals already exposed to the virus (Kuang et al., 2022). They further established that the drug, MBP134, maintained its efficacy when administered intramuscularly, and was more effective with shorter half-life compared to monotherapies. The other significant finding from the study is that the cocktail could be administered both intramuscularly and intravenously, also noting its effectiveness in both pre-exposure and post-exposure prevention and treatment respectively. Moreover, the researchers noted that MBP134 was associated with significantly lower doses of 5mg/kg compared to alternative treatments that required high doses of 50mg/kg and 150mg/kg to deliver similar protective effects (Kuang et al., 2022). \nFinally, the article by Kuang et al. (2022) details the findings of a pre-clinical. Such test in non-human primates is preceded by target identification and validation. In this case, the researchers must have identified the ideal mAbs to include as part of the antibody cocktail (MBP134). This was likely inspired by the need to develop a potent pre- and post-exposure treatment for EVD. Subsequently, the researchers settled on ADI-15878 and ADI-23774 as the ideal candidate mAbs (Kuang et al., 2022). This stage is followed by lead optimization that might have included a comprehensive study on the characteristics and potential interactions of these candidate monoclonal antibodies. The other that must have preceded the current stage of preclinical trials in nonhuman primates include in-vitro testing, in vivo testing in animal models, and preclinical safety assessment to identify any potential toxic effects of the mAb cocktail such as the likelihood of reproductive and developmental problems. Based on the current positive findings reported by Kuang et al. (2022) from the trials in NHP, the next phases of the study to validate the efficacy of the drug and hence adopt it for use include clinical trials, regulatory review, and post-marketing surveillance in case of approval (Kandi and Vadakedath, 2023). \nDiscussion \nThe development of the drug is a significant milestone in the efforts to contain ebolavirus vaccine. In particular, it strengthens response to other species of ebolavirus that the currently approved vaccines appear ineffective against. On this note, developing a vaccine that can address the other species of ebolavirus disease will be a significant milestone in the fight against the disease as pointed out by Liu et al. (2023). It will not only provide an alternative to the currently approved mono-antibody drugs. Moreover, the observed pre- and post-exposure effectiveness of this drug is another potential benefit in the fight against EVD. It could thus be used in Ebola endemic regions to protect vulnerable populations including the healthcare workers. \nBesides MBP134 cocktail, there are other Ebola vaccines and treatments under development. Of particular interest is the development of Inmazeb, targeting three discrete epitopes on the ebolavirus glycoprotein trimer (Rayaprolu et al., 2023). The drug also relies on the potential synergistic effects of monoclonal antibodies, with the findings of the study by Rayaprolu et al. (2023) affirming that cocktail of monoclonal antibodies have the potential to provide superior protection to patients. Such drugs with multiple constituents are likelier to protect against potential cases of resistance. Inmazeb has since received FDA approval as an effective treatment for ebolavirus, indicating that MBP134 could be equally potent and effective in Ebola disease prevention and treatment.  Unlike MBP134, however, Inmazeb is mainly effective against Zaire ebolavirus, leaving a gap for the management of other five species of ebolavirus (Saxena et al., 2021). MBP134 emerges as potential solution to bridge to treat the other species of ebolavirus.\nBased on the report by Steenhuysen (2022), the development of the drug appears to have made significant progress resulting in a preliminary approval for use in humans, particularly nurses and other medics responding to Sudan species of ebolavirus disease in Uganda. Further developments on this antibody cocktail will include the completion of clinical trials. Subsequently, the drug could be considered for approval and for use by patients to treat a wide range of coronaviruses. However, post-marketing surveillance will also help to ascertain its safety in clinical settings and to concurrently protect the patients and public in general.', "Nurturing Citizenship through Civic Engagement: A Transformative Journey Entry 3: Reflecting on Civic Engagement Experiences My life in terms of community service and citizenship has undergone a radical transformation thanks to the CEP. As I embarked on this endeavor, delivering Thanksgiving meals at the Salvation Army and creating personalized birthday cakes for underprivileged youth through Cakes 4 Kids, my experiences became a testament to the transformative power of civic engagement. In one aspect of my CEP, I was thrown into delivering Thanksgiving food supplies to those who depend on them at the Salvation Army. The gratitude and the joy displayed by most of them, often elderly individuals or citizens facing economic challenges, underscored the significance of community service. Thanksgiving, a time to reflect on gratitude, became a tangible expression of care, compassion, and inclusivity. The practice that has been my family's culture over time gave me more than satisfaction but a chance to interface with values such as support, care, and community building. The impact of family values that involved ideas like honesty, empathy, and gratitude was revealed in my path through the difficulties of life. The pain from my relatives' greediness was a humbling ambassador for the virtues of giving and being thankful. My mother supported me during all the hardships, strengthening my pre-conviction that society and reciprocity are effective anti-loneliness shields. All these events have influenced my values and defined an avenue of civic engagement on issues that promote a sense of belonging. My search for volunteering projects brought me to Cakes 4 Kids, where I utilized my skill in cake decoration to bring joy to underprivileged youth. Collaborating with a social worker from Boys Town, I crafted a personalized Harry Potter cake for a 14-year-old boy, marking a significant departure from traditional volunteer activities. This experience emphasized the pivotal effects of natural actions that can become emblems for those who could never enjoy a proper celebration. Through these experiences, the nature of engaged citizenship came alive. Volunteering was about addressing immediate needs and creating a sense of belonging. In my experiences with diverse people with different morals and values, I observed the development of empathy toward others and social awareness. Trying to follow civic virtue, I was aware that an enlightened and ethically motivated citizen is a resourceful asset for society, contributing towards establishing strong bonds in terms of civil fabric. When I think about these moments, the idea of citizenship becomes more important to me. The United States Department of Justice's Citizenship Rights and duties guide, which I use as a guide, always comes to mind. It stresses that rights come with duties. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson urged us to work for a better society (Cooney, 2012). These words hit home for me more than ever because I know that being a good citizen means giving up our own time and resources to help others. Moving forward, my CEP will positively impact the community and society. Apart from their immediate effect of ensuring meals and celebrations are assured, such activities contribute to societal transformation. In interacting with destitute people, volunteers actively take part in positive change development (Cooney, 2012). Bottom-up actions are transnational, spreading beyond national boundaries and influencing world attitudes to civic power and citizenship. In conclusion, my Civic Engagement Project has been a personal development and engagement process. My concept of engaged citizenship is informed by the values I learned from my family, life difficulties that taught me lessons, and volunteer work. These activities are not only in harmony with the objectives of this course but also embody American ideals and help build a perfect society (Madison, 1788). Evident with the result of my CEP, engaged citizenship has an impact to affirm that small, focused efforts do go a long way in molding a better world. Entry 4: Exploring the Role of the Organization in Society Turning to my Civic Engagement Project (CEP) details, I discovered different aspects of this organization's role. Cakes 4 Kids, the organization that aimed to offer individualized birthday cakes for underprivileged youths, provided both channels of joy and transformative forces in constructing well-being. From the standpoint of a client, this effect is incredible. In addition to providing sweet treats for the children and their families, Cakes 4 Kids surpasses this simple gesture of generosity. It becomes a reason to celebrate, a concrete expression of support and compassion (Franck, 2001). For them, the organization fills a void in their lives by providing an opportunity for one to celebrate a birthday that may otherwise be beyond reach due to financial constraints. The organization drives positive social change by addressing essential needs – the desire to celebrate and be recognized, even among those in economic distress. To a person served by Cakes 4 Kids, the organization represents more than just a provider of cakes; it stands as a symbol of community support, a beacon of hope, and an embodiment of the kindness that can thrive within society. A deeper understanding of motivations and contributions emerges by taking a different lens and viewing the organization from one angle to another, such as that of employees, senior volunteers, or organizational leaders. The people associated with Cakes 4 Kids are driven by a common cause to bring positive change in the lives of disadvantaged children. Whether through baking, coordinating, or managing, individuals within the organization contribute their time and skills with a sense of purpose – a purpose rooted in the belief that every child deserves to feel special on their birthday. Organizational leaders and volunteers share a unified goal of improving society through small, meaningful gestures. Their motivations are not self-centered and represent an aspiration to build a healthy society. The act of volunteering or working for Cakes 4 Kids is driven by a desire to contribute to a cause larger than oneself, embodying the principles of civic engagement and social responsibility (Bellah et al., 1996). People promote society's interests by actively participating in organizational activities. They play an essential part in creating an ideal society by dealing with the needs of those who are most vulnerable (Kluger, 2007). Under the prism of engaged citizenship, such individuals prefer to become involved in civic affairs and improve their community. Considering Cakes 4 Kids' impact on society, this organization may play a microcosm of positive change. Its effects go beyond the world of baking and delivering cakes; it cultivates a sense of belonging, builds hope, and promotes better citizens. The organization demonstrates that bottom-up initiatives can bring about major societal transformation. In conclusion, my reflection on the organization for this Civic Engagement Project has shed light on its significant role as a social transformer. From providing happiness to the street kids to developing solidarity among its volunteers, Cakes 4 Kids finally turns out to be a mighty, powerful force for good. Thinking about the views of those served and all stakeholders in this case, I realize that our civic decisions have a natural effect on building a better community. Cakes 4 Kids demonstrates that even small-scale, concerted actions can make positive change and help improve human well-being in communities. Entry 5: Exploring Perceptions and Societal Impact As my CEP develops, it becomes more crucial to look into the perception of organization and performances towards other members of society. Volunteers, organizational leaders, and community members provide insight into this initiative's broader scope of impact as they reveal its perceived function and value. Volunteering with Cakes 4 Kids has allowed me to meet people with similar values and care about helping underprivileged youth. Discussions with other volunteers identified a range of incentives for involvement. First, some individuals are attracted to the organization because of their passion for cakes, while others see it as an opportunity to give a chance (Tomasello, 2018). The range of motives reflects the organization's capabilities to recruit people with various talents and knowledge, contributing to a communicative team-oriented environment. It is equally important to understand the viewpoints not shared by those participating directly as volunteers. How do outsiders – knowledgeable but not tactically involved with the organization- perceive Cakes 4 Kids? Is the organization considered beneficial, and is a larger goal or social good somehow evident here? Interaction with community members helps better understand the perceived scope of influence for an organization beyond its direct participants. The motivations of volunteers, as expressed in conversations, align with the course concepts related to a good society, civic virtue, and engaged citizenship. The diverse backgrounds and skills brought by volunteers reflect the richness of social capital in action. Social capital refers to the networks, norms, and trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit (Putnam, 2000). Through their engagement with Cakes 4 Kids, volunteers actively contribute to the development of social capital within the community, fostering a sense of shared purpose and collaboration. In the case of examining views related to outsiders or individuals not involved in this organization, one can see that Cakes 4 Kids is treated as more than just a baking project. The organization is identified as beneficial and meaningful by observers who, in turn, ascribe social benefits to its activities. The organization is dedicated to making personalized birthday cakes to underprivileged youths, which is seen as a tangible contribution to building a better community (Pinhey & Boyer, 1997). This correlates with the course’s focus on citizen participation and its importance in achieving positive social change. Exploration of society's gains from the contributions made by those involved in Cakes 4 Kids uncovers a complicated impact. It brings joy and celebration among disadvantaged youth on a personal level, which makes them feel like part of society. The ripple effect, however, extends beyond the immediate recipients of the cakes. By addressing a fundamental need for celebration, the organization contributes to building a sense of community and shared identity (Kluger, 2007). The social consequences of the Cakes 4 Kids charity are connected to course results, specifically those that pertain to Freedom and Responsibility. The organization provides volunteers a chance to practice their right of philanthropy. It goes beyond individual freedoms to include civic duty in responding to social issues (Bellah et al., 1996). With the help of such a process, volunteers articulate more precisely that Civic Responsibility not only is a privilege but also becomes something essential to improve communities. This addendum underscores the two-sidedness of individual reasons and community benefits associated with Cakes 4 Kids. The diversity of impulses among volunteers determines the strength of social capital, indicating how crucial collective behavior may be regarding community involvement. In addition, the positive perceptions of society towards this organization indicate societal worthiness and engaged citizenship, which resulted in a positive change. Through these reflections, it becomes evident that initiatives like Cakes 4 Kids play a pivotal role in building social capital, fostering engaged citizenship, and contributing to the realization of a good society. Entry 6: Culmination of Civic Engagement Reflection As my Civic Engagement Project (CEP) nears end, I reflect on the broader themes across the project, its link with course concepts, and how it has shaped me as a citizen. This entry synthesizes my project experiences and bridges them with the overarching principles that have guided me in my search for an ideal society and how even better citizens could participate. In summing up my CEP, it is clear that the activities performed, such as sharing holiday meals at the Salvation Army and designing birthday cakes for underprivileged youth with the Cakes 4 Kids group, signify values embodied in this course. These efforts reflect the practical implementation of American values and demonstrate the role that people on the ground can play in enlivening healthiness within society (Madison, 1788). The values of community, compassion, and inclusivity, integral to these projects are reflected in the basic tenets upon which American democracy rests. The assertion that active citizens are strengthening their nation unveils itself in my CEP. With my active engagement in these community service projects, I help to establish a more lively and loving society. We can see the link between engaged citizenship and societal strength discussed in this class through the power of small, individual change to address social needs. The realization that my civic engagement efforts contribute to the collective strength of the nation reinforces the importance of active participation in shaping a better society (Pinhey & Boyer, 1997). The commitment of my CEP to a good society is apparent in several ways. Although Salvation Army and Cakes 4 Kids initiatives are relatively different, they aim to solve the immediate need in the community by providing food during Thanksgiving or personalized birthday cakes. This behavior is consistent with the concept of civic virtue as elaborated in this course, which means that an individual should undertake actions to benefit their community and contribute to the commonwealth (Bellah et al., 1996). In addition, the active citizenship manifest in my CEP represents bottom-up social change. Instead of relying on systemic solutions, I proactively interact with the community to meet current demands. This matches the course's consideration of civic duty and how it could be used for individual and group issues and problem-solving (Franck, 2001). The recognition that societal change can be started from the ground level strengthens the idea of involved citizens as cornerstones driving community development. The projects serve as practical manifestations of the ideals enshrined in the Constitution and Declaration of Independence (Madison, 1788). The commitment to community service, as highlighted in the Salvation Army and Cakes 4 Kids initiatives, is integral to the American narrative, showcasing the enduring relevance of national values and cultural traditions in shaping societal change. In future, if I could redo my CEP, there are certain things I would do differently to become an effective citizen who is also engaged. A suggested area of expansion could be to explore more avenues for collaboration with local businesses or institutions to amplify the reach and impact of community initiatives. With the help of partnerships, I will attract new resources and extend this assistance further. The collaborative approach aligns with the course's exploration of engaged citizenship emerging in response to 21st-century challenges. Additionally, I would explore avenues for increasing public awareness about the initiatives and their impact. The projects can generate increased interest and participation through social media, community activities, or support from local media organizations. This complements the focus of this course on the impact change has on the American Republic as well as global society, noting its need for widespread awareness driving positive social transformation (Cooney, 2012). In conclusion, the reflection on my Civic Engagement Project demonstrates that community service can be a tool for changing citizenship into an engaged variety and for building a good society. The consistency of the projects with course ideas and learning intentions supports the fact that specific actions arising from American values may contribute to building a cohesive social fabric. While recognizing the positive impact achieved, the contemplation of potential improvements highlights the ongoing evolution of engaged citizenship and the pursuit of more effective ways to contribute to the well-being of the community and society at large.", "The importance of transgender cultural competency in Psychiatric and Mental Health (PMH) Nursing cannot be underestimated due to the interpersonal nature of care delivery in this department. This study proposed to review the literature on transgender cultural competency for PMH Nurses with the aim of synthesizing current studies to collate findings that could inform better cultural competency of healthcare providers in mental health settings. This paper is based on the PICO question “In psychiatric and mental health nurses, does transgender cultural competency training, as compared to no specific transgender training or standard training, improve healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and staff engagement in serving transgender patients?”. The key search terms such as “cultural competency”, “mental health services”, “substance use treatment”, “healthcare staff training”, and “healthcare inclusion” were combined variously using Boolean operators and searched in major databases such as Google Scholar, Medline, and CINAHL to identify relevant papers from the past five years. The papers were screened against pre-established inclusion criteria to determine their relevance for inclusion in the data synthesis. The study will guide cultural competency training to foster more affirmative and inclusive environments in which transgender patients seeking mental health services are accommodated. The table below is a summary of the search methods. \n\nReview of Study Methods\nA rigorous research methodology is vital in the design of a systematic literature review study. The approach must be designed to facilitate the identification, selection, and integration of a wide range of studies on transgender cultural competency in psychiatric and mental health nursing. Following identification and study selection, data were extracted from the chosen studies, and a thematic analysis was conducted for a detailed examination of the selected studies to identify common themes and trends. This methodological decision is effective in clarifying details and complexities within the literature, providing a deep understanding of key topics and issues related to transgender cultural competence as explained by Bettergarcia et al. (2021). The table below summarizes the key evidence collected from the literature search.\n\nA combination of diverse research methodologies in a review study adds value and perspectives. This literature review utilizes a diverse array of research designs such as experimental studies, consensus recommendations, mixed-methods designs, and cross-sectional surveys. This diversity in methodological approaches increases the rigor and breadth of the analysis of transgender cultural competency training interventions. Causality between interventions and outcomes is also shown by experimental studies such as Rhoten et al. (2021). Foundational best practices are provided by expert consensus guidelines such as Pratt-Chapman et al. (2022). Mixed-methods research such as Lee et al. (2020) combines objective and subjective data to provide a balanced view, while cross-sectional surveys such as Burgwal et al. (2021) provide information on attitudes and confidence levels among larger populations. As a whole, these varied methodologies allow for multi-dimensional evidence of training effectiveness, shed light on subjective experiences, establish expert standards, and measure effects across contexts.\nReview Synthesis\nThe literature demonstrates that specialized transgender cultural competency training for mental health staff can significantly enhance provider knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and skills in serving transgender patients. Studies reveal training focused specifically on transgender individuals consistently improves understanding of gender identity, transition-related treatment, and minority stressors faced by this population (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Burgwal et al., 2021). Tailored curriculum content drives more meaningful competency development compared to general diversity education. Enhanced knowledge transforms attitudes, promoting more affirmative, sensitive approaches to care (Pratt-Chapman et al., 2022). Training also builds self-efficacy, empowering providers and reducing apprehension about meeting transgender patients' needs. Overall, the evidence underscores that comprehensive staff-wide training initiatives explicitly focused on transgender cultural competency are key to closing existing quality gaps in mental healthcare. Such specialized training can equip providers with the knowledge, capabilities, and perspectives needed to offer inclusive, patient-centered care aligned with guidelines.\nThe literature has significant implications regarding whether transgender cultural competency training for psychiatric and mental health nurses can improve healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and engagement in serving transgender patients. The evidence demonstrates specialized training focused on transgender individuals is more impactful than general diversity education in building competency (Burgwal et al., 2021). This indicates mental health organizations should implement tailored training initiatives to see meaningful improvements. Comprehensive curriculum content specifically addressing transgender experiences and needs is essential for driving gains in knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy among staff (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020). Sustained, multipronged approaches are recommended, rather than one-off education sessions (Pratt-Chapman et al., 2022). Given the benefits of specialized training revealed across studies, mental health clinics need to invest dedicated resources and time into developing staff-wide transgender competency. This can empower providers to translate new capabilities into practice changes that create more affirmative, culturally sensitive environments. Targeted training initiatives are key to bridging quality gaps and enabling staff to actively engage in meeting transgender patients’ needs.\nTheme Development\nPractice guidelines underscore the need for specialized staff training in serving unique populations. This aligns with trends emphasizing culturally competent care as noted in the 4 studies selected above. The literature highlights training focused on improving provider knowledge, attitudes, and confidence as a key theme (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Burgwal et al., 2021). For example, Rhoten et al. (2021) found training increased knowledge, affirmative attitudes, and self-efficacy among providers. However, a quality gap persists, as many providers still report inadequate preparation for serving transgender clients according to the discussion presented by Burgwal et al. (2021). Without competency training, transgender individuals may face discriminatory treatment and poor mental health outcomes (Burgwal et al., 2021). The literature underscores the urgent need for interventions tailored to enhancing staff cultural competency related to transgender patients. Focused training can help close knowledge gaps, transform attitudes, and increase engagement in providing affirmative care. These themes are summarized in the table below and discussed individually as follows:\nImproved Provider Knowledge\nSpecialized training focused on transgender cultural competency is consistently associated with enhanced knowledge among mental health providers according to the studies reviewed herein. Multiple studies demonstrate interventions significantly improve understanding of appropriate terminology, gender identity development, transition-related care, and the health disparities faced by transgender individuals (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Burgwal et al., 2021). For instance, Burgwal et al. (2021) found providers who received transgender-specific training scored higher on knowledge assessments regarding gender dysphoria treatment and the risks transgender patients face in healthcare settings. Competency training equips providers with the fundamental knowledge needed to understand and meet the needs of their transgender patients. As Pratt-Chapman et al. (2022) guidelines emphasize, focused education is key to building a knowledgeable, skilled workforce able to provide affirmative, patient-centered care.\nEnhanced Provider Attitudes\nCultural competency training consistently transforms attitudes, reducing bias and promoting more sensitive perspectives regarding transgender patients. Studies reveal specialized curricula significantly improve attitudes and decrease prejudice among mental health professionals (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020). The attainment of new knowledge appears to drive this shift, as providers gain an understanding of the lived experiences and specific needs of transgender individuals. However, Pratt-Chapman et al. (2022) stress that changing attitudes requires going beyond just imparting information to actively addressing unconscious bias through reflection. Well-designed interventions can catalyze meaningful attitude change, fostering more compassionate, culturally responsive approaches to working with transgender patients.\nIncreased Self-efficacy/Confidence\nMultiple studies reveal specialized training cultivates greater confidence and self-efficacy related to serving transgender patients. Pre-post evaluations show interventions significantly increase providers' confidence in their knowledge, attitudes, and clinical skills about transgender individuals (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020). For instance, Lee et al. (2020) found training was associated with dramatic gains in self-efficacy for providing culturally sensitive care, facilitating medical transition, and addressing discrimination. Burgwal et al. (2021) also found prior transgender-specific training had a substantial positive impact on providers' confidence levels. By imparting knowledge and abilities through applied learning, competency training empowers providers and reduces apprehension. This instills readiness to meet the nuanced needs of this patient population.\nSpecialized Curriculum Content \nGuidelines universally recommend that transgender-specific content be integrated into cultural competency training, rather than general education about LGBTQ populations (Pratt-Chapman et al., 2022). Tailored curricula focusing on transgender individuals' distinct experiences and needs consistently demonstrate greater improvements in providers' knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy compared to broader inclusion programs (Rhoten et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Burgwal et al., 2021). For instance, Burgwal et al. (2021) found specialized training yielded greater gains in competence than general diversity education. A focused approach allows for an in-depth understanding of issues like gender transition, minority stress, and disparities faced by transgender patients. Specialized content is key to meaningful competency development.\nTable  Theme analysis summary per study.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the literature supports that implementing transgender cultural competency training for mental health staff can improve healthcare outcomes and patient satisfaction among transgender patients in mental health settings. Also, staff engagement in serving transgender clients could benefit from such training. Studies demonstrate specialized training enhances provider knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and skills in working with this population. Expert guidelines also emphasize ongoing staff education to increase understanding and competency related to transgender health needs. Despite quality gaps, the evidence indicates that staff-wide training initiatives focused specifically on transgender cultural competency can translate knowledge into impactful practice changes that promote more affirmative, patient-centered mental healthcare for transgender clients.", 'Abstract: This study investigates the differential gene expression of VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 at sea level (SL) and high altitude (HA) environments to understand the impact of hypoxia on human physiology. Utilizing real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), we analyzed mRNA expression levels in blood samples collected from volunteers residing at SL in Jeddah and HA in Taif. Our results indicate a significant upregulation of VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 mRNA expression in HA compared to SL, suggesting a systemic adaptation to hypoxic conditions at the cellular level. The findings provide insights into the pathophysiological changes associated with high altitude living and underscore the potential for medical research in disease prevention and treatment strategies related to hypoxia. Further research with a larger cohort is recommended to explore the broader implications of hypoxia-induced gene expression alterations. Introduction\nThe study of gene expression in response to environmental changes is a pivotal aspect of molecular biology and genetics. This research focuses on the comparative analysis of gene expression at sea level (SL) and high altitude (HA), particularly examining the genes VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1. These genes are known to play crucial roles in the body’s response to hypoxia, which is a common stress factor at high altitudes (Chapman and waldenstrom 2015).\nIn this study, we collected blood samples from 10 volunteers residing at SL in Jeddah and HA in Taif. The primary aim was to determine if there are significant changes in the expression of VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 genes when transitioning from SL to HA conditions. The rationale behind selecting these specific genes stems from their involvement in hypoxia-inducible pathways, which are essential for cellular adaptation to reduced oxygen availability (Semenza 2007).\nThe RNA was meticulously extracted from fresh EDTA-treated whole blood samples using the QIAamp® RNA Blood Mini Kit, ensuring the integrity of the RNA for accurate real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The qRT-PCR was performed to quantify the mRNA expression levels of the target genes, providing insights into the physiological adaptations to HA environments.\nThis research contributes to the broader understanding of how living at different altitudes influences gene expression. It also explores the potential pathophysiological implications of these changes, such as alterations in organ function and the body’s ability to respond to hypoxic stress. The findings of this study have the potential to inform medical research, particularly in the development of treatments for diseases related to hypoxia and high-altitude living.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \nSample Collection\nBlood samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers at sea level (SL) in Jeddah and at high altitude (HA) in Taif. The purpose was to compare gene expression levels of VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR).\n\nRNA Isolation\n RNA was isolated from fresh EDTA-treated whole blood samples. The isolation process was carried out using the QIAamp® RNA Blood Mini Kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The procedure involved several steps to ensure the purity and integrity of the RNA, which are critical for accurate qRT-PCR results.\nQRT-PCR methods\nAfter completing the experiment, RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent according to its accompanying instructions. This RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the help of the MultiScribe RT enzyme kit. The resulting cDNA underwent triplicate analysis through real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System in Foster City, California, USA. The threshold cycle (Ct) values of the target genes were compared with those from a reference sample to assess the relative gene expression alterations. Adjustments for gene expression changes were made by normalizing the expression of the GAPDH housekeeping gene. The normalization of target gene Ct values against the GAPDH gene was executed employing the 2-∆∆Ct method described by Livak & Schmittgen [1]. Table 1 (Biovision, USA) lists the specific primer sequences employed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 samples were selected and sent for QRT-PCR as shown in table (1) below. \n\nGene Expression Analysis\nThe threshold cycle (Ct) values of the target genes were normalized against the GAPDH housekeeping gene to account for any sample-to-sample variation. The relative gene expression changes were calculated using the 2^-ΔΔCt method, which provides a quantitative measure of the fold changes in gene expression between the SL and HA samples.\nPrimer Sequences\nSpecific primer sequences were used for the amplification of the target genes. These primers were designed to have high specificity and efficiency, as indicated by their performance in preliminary experiments. The primer sequences, along with their respective accession numbers and amplification efficiencies, are listed in Table 2.\n\nTable2. Primer used for qRT-PCR amplification.\n\n\nData Analysis\nThe study employed both absolute and relative quantification methods to analyze the qRT-PCR data. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification, used in this study, relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in the HA group to that of the SL group, serving as an untreated control.\n\n\nResults\nThe study’s quantitative analysis revealed significant alterations in mRNA expression levels of the genes VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 when comparing samples from high altitude (HA) to those from sea level (SL). The qRT-PCR data, presented in Figures 1, 2, and 3, demonstrate these changes.\n\nVHLEL Gene Expression\nFigure 1 illustrates a significant upregulation of VHLEL mRNA expression in the HA group, with a fold change of 3.5 (p<0.05). This increase suggests an enhanced response to hypoxic conditions prevalent at high altitudes.\n\n\n\n\nVEGF Gene Expression\n As depicted in Figure 2, the VEGF gene also showed a notable increase in mRNA expression in the HA group, with a fold change of 1.9 (p<0.05). VEGF is a critical factor in angiogenesis, and its upregulation may indicate a physiological adaptation to ensure adequate oxygen supply under reduced atmospheric oxygen levels.\n\n\nHIFa-1 Gene Expression\nThe most pronounced change was observed in the HIFa-1 gene, where Figure 3 shows a 6.9-fold increase in mRNA expression in the HA group compared to the SL group (p<0.05). HIFa-1 is a key regulator in the cellular response to hypoxia, and its substantial upregulation aligns with the body’s adaptive mechanisms to HA environments.\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe statistical significance of the gene expression differences was determined using the Student’s t-test, with a p-value threshold of <0.05 considered indicative of a significant difference. The fold changes were calculated using the 2^-ΔΔCt method, providing a reliable measure of gene expression alterations due to environmental changes.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe results of this study provide compelling evidence for the overexpression of VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 genes in individuals residing at high altitude (HA) compared to those at sea level (SL). This overexpression is indicative of a systemic adaptation to the hypoxic conditions encountered at HA, which is characterized by reduced oxygen availability.\n\nThe VHLEL gene, known for its role in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (Jin et al. 2018), showed a 3.5-fold increase in mRNA expression at HA. This suggests that the body’s hypoxic response mechanisms are activated to cope with the oxygen-deficient environment. Similarly, the VEGF gene, crucial for angiogenesis, exhibited a 1.9-fold increase, potentially facilitating new blood vessel formation to improve oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\nThe most significant finding was the 6.9-fold upregulation of HIFa-1, a master regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia. This gene’s activation triggers a cascade of events leading to enhanced erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming, all of which are vital for survival at HA.\n\nThe overexpression of these genes may have direct pathophysiological implications, particularly in organs such as the kidneys and liver, which are sensitive to changes in oxygen levels. For instance, increased expression of HIFa-1 and VEGF can lead to alterations in renal and hepatic functions, potentially contributing to the development of altitude-related health issues.\n\nFurthermore, the study’s findings align with previous research indicating that chronic exposure to HA conditions can result in structural and functional changes in the body, leading to various pathophysiological diseases (Soliman et al., 2022). The increased expression of cytokines and activation of genes related to HA adaptation support this notion.\n\nIt is also worth noting that HA living can increase the susceptibility of several organs to oxidative stress due to decreased oxygen delivery. This study’s results corroborate the hypothesis that systemic adaptation occurs at the cellular level under intermittent hypoxic conditions, as evidenced by the upregulation of the studied genes.\n\nBroader Context and Future Research: The implications of these findings extend beyond the scope of high-altitude physiology and into the realm of medical research. Understanding the genetic response to hypoxia can inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases where oxygen deprivation plays a role (Clinical Chemistry 2004)(Widowati et al., 2016). Further research with a larger and more diverse cohort is essential to validate these results and explore additional hypoxia-related genes.\n\nConclusion\nThe present study’s findings underscore the significant impact of high altitude (HA) living on gene expression, particularly concerning VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1. The observed upregulation of these genes in HA residents compared to those at sea level (SL) provides a molecular basis for the physiological adaptations to hypoxia. These adaptations are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in oxygen-deprived environments and may have far-reaching implications for medical research (Tedeschi 2012).\n\nThe increased mRNA expression levels of VHLEL, VEGF, and HIFa-1 not only reflect the body’s immediate response to hypoxic stress but also suggest a long-term acclimatization strategy that could influence organ function and disease susceptibility. The study’s results contribute to a growing body of evidence that links hypoxia-induced gene expression changes to various pathophysiological conditions (Schmittgen 2001), including pulmonary hypertension, chronic mountain sickness, and even certain cancers.\n\nMoreover, the research highlights the potential for developing novel therapeutic interventions targeting these hypoxia-responsive genes. Such treatments could be particularly beneficial for individuals with conditions characterized by chronic hypoxia or for those undergoing adaptation to high altitudes (Polotsky et al., 2008).\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying human adaptation to HA and lays the groundwork for future investigations. Expanding this research to include a broader range of hypoxia-related genes and a larger, more diverse population could further elucidate the complex interplay between gene expression and environmental factors. Ultimately, this could pave the way for innovative approaches to treating diseases associated with hypoxia and improving the health and well-being of populations residing at high altitudes., "Decision Making in Nursing\nIn the ever-evolving field of healthcare, nurses remain on the frontline in providing care to patients. At the core of their work is the delicate art of decision-making, which involves integrating ethics, clinical skills, cultural sensitivity, spirituality, and good political sense. Client-focused nursing practice is guided by the concept of patient-centered care, whereby the patients autonomy, dignity, and individual preferences are given prime considerations in every clinical decision (Rafii, Nasrabadi & Tehrani, 2021). Therefore, this requires an intricate balance that ensures respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice while dealing with the complexities of the healthcare system. Critical thinking is a fundamental skill for nurses that allows them to be able to evaluate comprehensively information as well as data to assist in their practice. Along with handling the complexities of decision-making, nurses also exhibit leadership at organizational, local and global level. Nurses do so by offering solutions based on medical research and cultural competence, while preventing medical errors, hazards, and promoting quality care.\nUnderstanding the Essence of Decision-Making in Nursing\nUnderstanding the essence of decision-making in nursing reveals a deep-rooted commitment to the principles of client centered care, a top philosophy which puts patient health, self-determination, and the individual preferences first when decision making is done. Spirituality is at the core of this approach, and it is so much more than just a medical procedure; it represents the total understanding of the individual. Nurses, as advocates and caregivers, start their journey by juggling the delicate balancing of the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.\nOne of the significant aspects of patient-centered care is autonomy, which entails respecting the client’s right to self-determination and making informed decisions. This calls for managing peoples health in the way they wish, enabling a sense of ownership over their health journey. Whereas beneficence involves the nurses efforts at improving the health of the patient through administering treatments, comfort and resources as a way of doing good, non-maleficence is a reminder that nurses may need to weigh up the benefits and risks of any intervention with the goal of avoiding or preventing any harm to the patients (Cheraghi et al., 2023). Justice guides nurses to promote fairness and equity as a way of ensuring that patients get proper care irrespective of their backgrounds and situations.\nWithin this ethical framework, nurses react to various circumstances of the healthcare system and acknowledge complex problems that may arise. They will acquire medical care for individual patients and the social determinants of health, which can have a decisive role in health. Various factors, including economic status, ethnicity, treatment availability, and environmental influences play critical roles in shaping health outcomes among patients. Cultural competence can be said to offer a significant advantage, as it helps nurses take into account the numerous beliefs, values and practices that influence how people perceive and seek healthcare. A culturally sensitive nurse has the knowledge of how cultural norms impact health behaviors and is flexible in taking this into account when developing care plans. Such a nurse will be able to build trust and good rapport with patients from various ethnic roots by assisting them.\nIntegrating Critical Thinking and Clinical Reasoning\nCritical thinking and clinical reasoning are the pillars of nursing practice, serving as the guide through the complexities of patient care. These skills are intertwined, and give nurses the ability to critically analyze information and apply the most suitable evidence in order to achieve the best outcomes for patients (Wong & Kowitlawakul, 2020). Critical thinking in nursing is more than just a problem-solving tool, and it represents a systematic approach to questioning, analyzing, and synthesizing information. In learning to evaluate the validity and dependability of data, nursing students understand how biases and assumptions can affect clinical decisions. This skill allows nurses to go deeper below the surface-level symptoms to recognize patterns, trends, and potential complications that may be affecting the patient’s health. In addition, critical thinking enables nurses to evaluate the different views and search for innovative solution to the complex problems. It promotes an active care model, in which nurses foresee potential problems, create contingency plans, and continuously evaluate the success of the interventions. Critical thinking generally enables nurses to be dynamic problem solvers, capable of adapting to changing patient demands and clinical situations.\nAlong with critical thinking is clinical reasoning, which is the capacity to apply the theoretical knowledge to real-world patient situations. Clinical reasoning is a blend of evidence-based practices, patient preferences and contextual factors, which are synthesized to come up with holistic treatment plans (Wong & Kowitlawakul, 2020). Nurses apply their clinical knowledge, intuitions, and past experiences in order to make timely and effective decisions that are in the best interests of their patients. The basis of clinical reasoning is the understanding that each patient is unique. Besides the physical dimension of health, nurses examine also the emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of health. They take into account patients beliefs, values and goals, providing customized care plans that suit each individual and his or her healing process. Efficient clinical reasoning also requires a comprehensive knowledge of the possible risks and benefits of treatments. Nurses evaluate the evidence, determine the probability of outcomes, and work with patients to make shared decisions. This interactive approach develops a feeling of cooperation between nurses and patients which in turn gives individuals the chance to get actively involved in their care.\nThe Role of Leadership in Decision-Making\nThe function of leadership in decision-making in nursing extends beyond the boundaries of individual patients. It embodies the multifaceted approach, which influences organizational, local, and global healthcare. Nurses as leaders are key since they determine policies, spearhead initiatives, and defend patient rights while at the same time dedicating themselves to high quality care delivery. Fundamentally, nursing leadership is about motivating and supporting others to fulfill common objectives that result in quality care and better patient outcome (Salvage & White, 2019). As change agents, nurse leaders are at the forefront of trendsetting, introducing new interventions, and creating a culture of continuous learning within healthcare environments. They work with interdisciplinary teams, bring forth various viewpoints and knowledge to design extensive care plans which are targeted to the overall requirements of patients.\nNurse leaders perform various important functions in organizational settings. They guide nursing teams, allocate resources, and navigate a complicated healthcare system. They are nurses champions, orchestrating the necessary support, training, and resources for nurses to provide the best possible patient care (Salvage & White, 2019). By effective leadership nurses are given the chance to realize their potential and advance helpful culture among other nurses characterized by professionalism, compassion and excellence. Additionally, nursing leadership reaches out to the local community to be the voice of community health programs and community engagement. They partner with community groups, city agencies, and health providers to tackle community health disparities and improve preventive care. Usually, public health campaigns have nurse leaders who inform community members on disease prevention, healthy living choices and access to healthcare services among other things.\nNursing leadership has a transformational function in dealing with pressing health issues and access to health services equitably at the global level. Nursing leaders participate in international healthcare policies, take part in global health programs and work with international organizations to develop better healthcare systems globally. Their views are the most practicable in defending the rights of vulnerable groups, promoting evidence-based practices, and also in advancing nursing profession globally. Nursing leadership in decision-making is symbolized by the vision of inclusive, ethical, and patient-oriented care. Nurse leaders acts as key decision makers, reviewing and making choices that adhere to the values of the profession and are in the patients best interests. They encourage transparency, accountability, and a culture of continuous learning, proctoring the ethical conduct in every facet of care provision.\nEffective Communication\nEffective communication is the basis of nursing practice; it involves more than just verbal communication. It builds bonds of trust, empathy, and work relationship with patients and their families, as well as interdisciplinary teams. Nursing is among the skills that nurses use in healthcare to deal with the complexities of health care, patient advocacy, and seamless coordination of care delivery. Basically, successful communication in nursing implies the capacity to pass on clear, concise, and compassionate information. Nurses are the link between the medical systems and patients as they turn medical terms into the words that patients and families can understand. This clarity not only empowers patients to make educated decisions about their care, but also helps to seed a sense of partnership and shared decision making. In addition to verbal communication, a successful communicator also utilizes non-verbal cues that include body language, facial expressions, and gestures. Nurses detect these subtle signs which they utilize to assess the emotional status, comprehension level, and comfort level of the patient. A gentle touch, a kind look, or a warm presence communicates understanding better than spoken words by themselves. \nAlong with patient communication nurses also develop effective communication with interdisciplinary teams, working with physicians, therapists, social workers and other healthcare teams. Timely and clear communication among team members is a must for providing the patients with coherent and complete care plans. Nurses share patient data, determine treatment options and coordinate interventions to maximize patients results. Effective communication also proves to be of great significance in addressing patients concerns and demands. Nurses act as the advocate for the patient, making sure that their fears, selections and values are considered and respected. Through doing so, they advocate for the needed resources, initiate dialogues about their preferred treatment options, and help patients make choices that correspond with their goals of care. Also, as a result of the development of technology, nurses use various communication tools to improve patient care. Electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms and mobile applications emphasize communication, nurses being able to access patient information, collaborate with others colleagues and engage in virtual consultations. The improvements in these technologies allow the nurses to offer immediate and effective care services while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of patients.\nProposing Culturally Competent and Evidence-Based Care\nProposing culturally sensitive and evidence-based care in nursing is a best practice and a part of a holistic and patient-centered approach to care-giving. This strategy is based on the fact that patients can have different backgrounds, beliefs and values influencing their health outcomes and treatment effectiveness. The nurses who accept the culturally competent care make their interventions adapt freely to the cultural milieu of every single patient and thereby increase the trust, respect and health outcomes. Cultural competence in nursing starts from a profound knowledge and respect to various cultural norms, behaviors, and beliefs. It entails to acknowledge the role of culture in health behaviors, illness perceptions, and treatments choices. Being culturally competent, nurses participate in dialogues with patients and families, trying to get to know their specific experience and take it into account when making care plans.\nAnother important role of culturally competent care is that it goes beyond just being aware of cultural differences; it is a commitment to providing fair and inclusive care for everyone regardless of their status. Nurses aim to cultivate an atmosphere that includes all cultures and which is respectful of their uniqueness thus helping patients feel accepted, listened and understood. \nBesides proposing culturally competent care, nurses also stress out the significance of intervening health disparities that deeply affect majority populations. They support social justice and equity in healthcare, and they fight to remove barriers to access and encourage the use of preventive care and early intervention. Evidence-based practice (EBP) is the backbone of the culturally competent care. It refers to the application of the best evidence from research, clinical experience, and patients wishes and choices. Nurses who provide evidence-based care remain current with the latest research findings; evaluate evidence critically; and implement it judiciously, thus making informed decisions supported by evidence. Nurses are able to make interventions both effective and tailored to the individual needs of patients through the coordination of culturally competent care based on the best available evidence. This kind of strategy enables beneficial health effects while reducing the risks and complications inherent in the one-size-fits-all approach.\nCollaborative Teamwork\nCollaborative teamwork represents the central concept of nursing practice that reflects all the relevant components of partnership, joint responsibility and mutual respect among healthcare professionals. Healthcare realm is full of numerous and dynamic elements, whereby nurses, physicians, therapists, social workers and other staff members work as a team to offer patient centered and comprehensive care. An excellent team culture begins with appreciating the unmatched skills and different ideas of every employee. The nurses playing the pivotal role of the health care crew utilize their clinical knowledge, critical thinking, and compassion that make the whole process of work successful. They cooperate with doctors in designing treatment plans, administering treatment modalities, and tracking patient outcomes. Nurses and doctors’ teamwork and cooperation are based on mutual respect and regular use of communication. Due to this, they create healthy alliances that rely on mutual trust and shared aim of taking care of patients. Moreover, collaboration does not only involve the traditional healthcare settings and but also community partnerships and outreach programs. Nurses visit community centers and public health agencies to deal with social determinants of health and offer prevention care. Together with other partners in the community the nurses raise public awareness and inspire people to be responsible for their health that eventually cultivates a culture of community wellbeing and resilience.\nWhen nurses propose a joint approach, they suggest that change should be towards interprofessional education and practice. They are aware of such an imperative to study alongside other health care workers, in joint learning settings, skill development and professional growth. Through interprofessional education we develop a strong culture of collaboration rather than fragmentation, and establish a working structure of teamwork and assistance. Moreover, team building in nursing is realized by having good communication and joint decision-making among other team members as well. The involvement of nurses in multidisciplinary rounds, case conferences and care coordination meetings are heightened to achieve the objectives of evaluating patient progress, addressing predicaments, and designing joint care plans. With the help of information and insights nurses integrate the team, and because of that they are able to provide coordinated and comprehensive care. Nurses advocate for a culture of excellence through collaborative teamwork by working together in a supportive and inclusive environment. They, without a doubt, grasp the importance of recognizing and appreciating the role played by all the team members, including doctors, nurses, support staff, and admin. In a culture of excellence where respect and trust thrive, strengths of each team member are appreciated, thus teamwork and leadership take root.\nConclusion\nThe nursing decision-making is a multidimensional process which is the very core of care oriented to the patients. Nurses work with complexities of the issues related to ethics, clinical reasoning, cultural, spiritual and politic, to provide the healing of patients. During the process, they are growing professional qualities such as critical thinking, leadership, effective communication and ethical principles. By participating in collaborative teamwork and the never-ending learning process through reflection, nurses are able to take on the role of patient advocates and initiators of positive change in local and global health care systems.", "Advocating for Diversity: Addressing Skepticism\nEmpathy and Understanding: it is significant to demonstrate the capacity to understand the personality behind the stereotypes and the feelings of that person towards diversity. Taking the time to hear out actively and validate their concerns is a key step towards opening up and showing respect, which is certainly in our first columns of constructive dialogue. By showing empathy, you mutually acknowledge that the person or the group can be open and share more about their feelings and experiences, which builds trust for them (Dewidar et al.,2022). The attitude is the one that results from these approaches and not only reinforces the sense of connection but also works to break down defensiveness so that clear communication is more possible. Furthermore, a willingness to take their perspective without necessarily accepting a stop sign points to a desire to have a meaningful discussion with empathy and concern.\nHighlighting Tangible Benefits: Diversity is not a noble goal but a combination of reality supplemented by the advantages that can boost the standard of living and workplace. Through real-life examples and empirical data,  one can demonstrate how diversity encourages novelty, stimulates the imagination, and accelerates problem-solving (Dewidar et al.,2022). Teams composed of different people play useful roles, and they throw in a variety of viewpoints, aptitudes, and backgrounds, resulting in healthier discussions and holistic approaches. Additionally, research has always indicated that diverse workplaces perform generally stronger financially than homogeneous ones and are more likely to survive over a long period. By highlighting these obvious payoffs, one can argue that diversity is a cause of moral necessity and strategic advantage in todays world, where everything is interconnected.\nAppealing to Ethics and Values: Fundamentally, advocating for diversity means promoting fairness, equality, and social justice, which is essential for a just society. It is important to highlight values and ethical principles that are universally acceptable to frame diversity as both profitable and morally necessary (Dewidar et al.,2022). Indicate the significance of forming welcoming spaces where everybody, irrespective of their position or identity, feels respected, esteemed, and powerful enough to develop. Demonstrate how accepting diversity is just in accordance with human rights principles and conducive to achieving societal equity and consensus. \nExamining Diversity as a Potential Negative Factor\nWhile diversity holds tremendous potential for fostering innovation and resilience, its complexities necessitate careful navigation. Acknowledging the potential negative factors associated with diversity is crucial for cultivating inclusive environments where all individuals feel valued and respected. \nPotential for Friction and Conflict: The diversity, a source of numerous positives, also results in difficulties and complexities. Thus, they must be given due attention. Another issue considered a drawback of diversity is the chance of diversity unintentionally driving friction or disagreement among communities or groups. Disparities in cultural habits, ways of communication, and values between individuals can cause misunderstanding or tension, which, in turn, impactability of collaboration and cohesion (Dewidar et al.,2022). In environments where diversity is not effectively managed or assisted, these gaps become harmful divisions that obstruct the high objectives of collective identity.\nLogistical Challenges and Resource Strain: Along with social relations, diversity can challenge structural issues, especially in settings where agencies have limited accommodation for deviations or flexibility in guidelines. Accommodating various demands and individual performances, such as language services or religious observances, requires more resources and increased time for proper management (Dewidar et al.,2022). Organizations that do not have the appropriate help and support mechanisms often find it difficult to align with the different needs of their members and leaders. Such challenges may lead to low morale and even lower productivity levels.\nRisk of Misguided Implementation :Besides, unplanned diversity measures could produce different negative consequences. For example, tokenism or cosmetic diversity programs may compromise the image and trustworthiness of organizations, and in turn, they probably continue systemic inequality (Dewidar et al.,2022). Likewise, applying diversity or minority quotas and mandates without considering merit or qualification may result in resentment or a morale downgrade within organizations. These outdated strategies often hamper the fast track to true inclusivity as well as reduce the effect of the potential advantages diversity provides.\nThe Role of Diversity in Academia\nFostering Inclusive Learning Environments: Diversity in academia is a platform used to build the welcoming stages where human complexity is booked by resolving all its attributes. Through the multicultural educational setting, encounters and interactions occur between students and academicians from diverse socio-economic, racial and cultural backgrounds, greatly influencing the learning procedure (Dewidar et al.,2022). The outcome of that is not only a certain mind openness but also furthers the development of critical thinking through dismantling assumptions and sparking empathy and active reasoning.\nAdvancing Knowledge and Scholarship: In addition, diversity plays a key role in advancing knowledge and research in the academic domain across all disciplines of study. The diverse views might ignite intellectual curiosities, further leading to innovations and consequently supporting discoveries and breakthroughs. Approaching an issue from various perspectives leads to more complete and detailed examinations that help us comprehend complex social aspects better and have a clearer image of the world around us (Dewidar et al.,2022). Additionally, the whole team members, with disparate skills and professional backgrounds, enrich the research more significantly, and the experiment is much more thorough.\nPromoting Social Justice and Equity: Apart from focusing on discovering new knowledge, academia must advance social justice and equity by examining historical inequities and dismantling barriers to access and success. Through active linguistic recruitment and development of students and faculties from underrepresented groups, the university can facilitate dismantling structural inequalities and providing equal opportunities to every individual (Dewidar et al.,2022). Diversity is about more than just reassuring diversity in the student population and educators, and in the curriculum that gives space to different voices and perspectives so people do not feel left out and all students are treated equally.\nIncorporating Diversity into General Education\nCultivating Cultural Competence: The inclusion of diversity is crucial for the development of cultural tact and for preparing students for a globalized and diverse world. Meeting diverse perspectives, stories, and cultures builds empathy, respect, and admiration for the amazing number of things the human community consists of (Dewidar et al.,2022). Through different content and experiences, educators can teach the knowledge and leadership abilities required to engage in the most diverse social and professional settings effectively.\nChallenging Assumptions and Biases : Also, making diversity a part of general education empowers students to rethink their assumptions and biases about themselves and others. Students can be taught to think in different ways and be different people than usual, go on to disprove stereotypes, and minimize inequities through the classroom environment (Dewidar et al.,2022). Reading different texts, stories, and other narratives fosters an analytical approach and self-awareness in students, giving them the power to internalize their ideas and biases.\nPreparing Global Citizens : Moreover, integrating diversity in the general education curriculum is a paramount factor in preparing students who will become educated citizens on a global level. In a globalized world, cultural understanding and intercultural communication skills are more relevant than ever (Dewidar et al.,2022). They ensure successful cooperation and great problem-solving skills. To promote students learning about varied perspectives and styles, general education can produce the aptitude and disposition required for variations in the world and social good.Ethical Foundations and Philosophy \nThe disposition to develop and maintain integrity in one’s work explains the competency of ethical foundations. As a sports administrator, encountering an ethical paradox, that is, making decisions between two options from a moral perspective can be challenging. It is vital for a sports administrator to render equitable decision-making based on ethical perspectives. Also, it is crucial for an administrator in sports to understand diverse ethical foundations to make considerable decisions when settling issues or leading the team (Loland, 2022). Ethical philosophy revolves around what is morally right and wrong and what is good and evil. Utilitarianism is another ethical philosophy that advocates for deeds that foster happiness or pleasure and opposes actions that degrade one’s happiness. This piece delves into ethical foundations and ethical philosophy, how they are applied in sports, and a reflection of how they align with my beliefs. \nEthical Foundations and Application to Sport Administration \nThe power of making choices based on setting fundamental values through knowledge, skills, and dispositions in life and work explains the ethical foundation. It involves professional conduct in making decisions, including thoughtful development, critique, and adherence to a comprehensive standard of ethics and commitment despite diverse circumstances (Masteralexis, 2023). Furthermore, ethical foundations develop rules, principles, and guidelines to discern right and wrong, as well as good and evil. Ethical foundations are crucial in sports administration in guiding and providing principles that positively impact the athletes, fans, and coaches, and integrity provides integrity in the sport (Kihl, 2019). One of the applications of moral foundations in sports administration is impartiality and justice. Sports administration must guarantee fairness in making decisions, competition, selecting teams, and allocating resources to maintain the genuineness of a sport (Kihl, 2019). This is to say that when implementing rules and regulations, it should be transparent without biasness, favoritism, bribery, rigging, and discrimination. It promotes respect and dignity, sportsmanship, and mutual optimal values. \nAnother application is upholding the principles of accountability and responsibility. Sports administrators should be accountable for their decisions and not make excuses through whining and complaining. They should take ownership of something and critique their own performance. Also, the sport’s stakeholders, that is, athletes and coaches, should comply with anti-doping regulations while the latter takes responsibility for the athletes’ development and welfare (Loland, 2022). Furthermore, fair play and sportsmanship form significant moral virtues in sports administration. This is to say, entailing the rule of compliance and commitment to contest in a satisfactory spirit and inspiring a good attitude toward the sport encompasses dignity, modesty, generosity, and friendship (Schroeder et al., 2019). Another application is creating transparency and openness for building trust and accountability, especially in decision-making processes and governance. Sports administrators should endeavor to be transparent in terms of communicating policies, decisions, goals, actions, and finances with stakeholders to build credibility and trust. Applying these ethical foundations in sports administration creates a culture of integrity, impartiality, respect, and dignity within sports.\n As a sports administrator, I reverberate strongly with the moral foundation of impartiality and justice. My rationale for this is that they are essential in ensuring that every aspect of sports, from hiring, firing, and decision-making, among others, is governed by principles of impartiality and justice. As a sports administration professional, I would apply fairness and justice to my decision-making by enforcing rules and regulations. This is to say, I will guarantee that my team members consistently apply, comply, and adhere to all degrees of competition. This insinuates that no athlete or team will secure preferential services over the others and ensure that all violations are punishable and addressed relatively. \nAnother way is to ensure no disparities in resource allotment. These resources include funding, facilities, sportswear, and coaching, meaning every player will receive equitable opportunities irrespective of background and status. Moreover, I would advocate for policies encouraging inclusivity and diversity within the sport. This means that there will be the implementation of nondiscriminatory programs within the team encompassing all types of races, genders, cultures, and persons living with disabilities. I would coalesce with other stakeholders to make decisions pertaining to the team to uphold transparency and accessibility of information. This will promote a culture of sportsmanship and fairness among the athletes, coaches, and other officials (Schroeder et al., 2019). Also, it will fuel the urge to educate the athletes about the significance of ethical behavior and moral principles in their endeavors. \nUtilitarianism and Application in Sports Administration\nUtilitarian philosophy is a morality theory that advocates for contentment or pleasure and opposes actions of unhappiness and distress. This ethical philosophy maximizes actions of welfare and happiness for affected persons, ensuring the exceptional good for a substantial number (Abumere, 2019). Jeremy Bentham, the founder of this theory, depicted the term ‘utilitarianism’ from utility and defined it as any property or object that tends to produce advantage, benefit, pleasure, and sound (Sinha, 2020). This theory is a version of consequentialism that depicts that morality is about producing the correct kinds of overall consequences. Utilitarianism considers the interests of humanity and all conscious beings equally, unlike egoism and altruism. The ancient Greek philosophers Aristippus and Epicurus proposed hedonism as the essential aspect of human good.\n Aristotle then argued that eudaimonia, which is the theory of good spirit, is the utmost form of human good, while Mozi proposed consequentialism (Abumere, 2019). All these proposals by the aforementioned philosophers merged to form utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position, with Jeremy Bentham as the originator. Some developers, like John Gay, developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics, stating that happiness is the ultimate end of all actions, as God wants humanity to be (Lythe, 2022). Gay’s theory was later modernized and popularized by William Paley through his book The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy (Alican, 2022). Later, Jeremy Bentham wrote a book on classical utilitarianism after seeing the success of William Paley, where he introduced the principle of utility and a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains. Bentham distinguished evil and sound through the theory of legislation, which other developers, like John Stuart Mill, intentionally modernized the theory to utilitarianism (Alican, 2022).\nUtilitarianism is applied in sports administration, especially in decision-making processes that maximize the welfare of the stakeholders. One way utilitarian principles can be applied is in resource allotment. When the officials allocate resources such as funding, facilities, and coaching anchorage, they apply utilitarianism to maximize the overall benefit for the athletic community (Gustafson, 2022). Directing resources toward initiatives has enormous potential to impact athletes, teams, and fans optimistically. When scheduling sports events, administrators contemplate facets such as fan attendance, television viewership, and athlete participation, maximizing the events’ comprehensive enjoyment and utility. This means that the administrators apply utilitarianism by ensuring that the fans enjoy the matches to the fullest by scheduling high-profile competitions when it is most convenient for players and spectators (Propheter & Dai, 2023). Another way this theory is applied in sports administration is in alternation or rules. \nUtilitarianism influences resolutions related to sports’ rules and regulations. To expound on that, administrators consider how modifying rules could intensify the experiences for athletes and viewers, leading to enormous amusement and satisfaction. Furthermore, they adjust rules to enhance impartiality in competition, escalate the safety of the athletes, and improve the entertainment value of the specific sport (Propheter & Dai, 2023). Moreover, this ethical philosophy is applied to sports administration because it acts as a framework for decision-making in cases where ethical quandaries arise. This means that by examining the potential consequences of diverse courses of action and choosing the option that maximizes happiness or pleasure, administrators can navigate complex moral issues to prioritize the considerable soundness for a substantial number of individuals (Gustafson, 2022). Also, it is applied in sports administration to balance the ethical principles in sports, that is, respect, justice, fairness, dignity, and integrity, to guarantee that the decisions made align with moral principles and professional standards. \nMy ethical beliefs center on happiness, pleasure, and justice. Utilitarianism aligns with my beliefs since it advocates for actions that foster happiness rather than harm. My rationale for this is that utilitarian philosophy resonates with the value of happiness as it emphasizes pleasures that lead to pleasure and joyfulness. Also, this philosophy represents my moral beliefs of fairness because, when applied extensively, it promotes justice by considering the happiness and well-being of others. Gestures that promote equity and disregard discrimination align with utilitarian principles of augmenting happiness. In my perspective, this philosophy offers a flexible approach to ethical decision-making. This is to say that balancing the significance of happiness and pleasure in diverse contexts can fuel decisions that optimize utility. \nUtilitarianism can guide my decision-making as a professional sports administrator in allocating resources, including funding and coaching anchorage, in a way that augments the benefits and happiness of the sport’s stakeholders at large. As a sports administrator, I might direct resources toward initiatives that positively impact athletes, teams, coaches, and fans. This philosophy would guide my decisions concerning the sport’s impact on the larger athletic community by prioritizing actions that augment optimal outcomes for a larger number of individuals. I would implement athletic community programs that will promote inclusivity, diversity, and equity, which will contribute to the happiness and welfare of the community. As a future sports administrator, utilitarianism will enable me to make decisions that prioritize happiness and utility for athletes, stakeholders, and the community.\nConclusion\nThe fundamental set of values in which an individual makes choices encapsulates ethical foundations. Establishing ethical foundations promotes fairness, justice, equity, accountability, and responsibility practices. In sports administration, moral principles are significant in maintaining the dignity and respect of the sport and the athletes. As depicted above, utilitarianism upholds happiness and pleasure, and when directed toward sports administration, it aims to improve the athletic community. As a future sports administrator, I would apply utilitarian philosophy in decision-making processes to maximize pleasure and happiness for the greatest number of individuals.", "Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery, and Crisis Management\nExplanation of Terms\nBusiness Continuity (BC): BC refers to the capability of an organization to continue its critical functions and operations during and after a disruption (Moşteanu, 2020). It involves the development of strategies, plans, and procedures to ensure the organization can continue operating or quickly resume operations in the event of unforeseen incidents such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or supply chain disruptions. BC encompasses proactive measures to prevent disruptions and reactive measures to respond to and recover from them.\nDisaster Recovery (DR): DR focuses specifically on the technology and data aspects of business continuity. It involves implementing strategies and plans to recover and restore IT systems, data, and infrastructure following a disruptive event (Moşteanu, 2020). The primary goal of DR is to minimize downtime and data loss, ensuring that critical IT services can be restored within acceptable timeframes. DR often includes measures such as data backups, redundant systems, and recovery procedures.\nCrisis Management (CM): CM involves the processes, structures, and strategies an organization uses to respond to and manage crises as they occur effectively. Crises can range from natural disasters and pandemics to public relations crises, cyber-attacks, labor strife, fire, and financial emergencies (Moşteanu, 2020). CM focuses on coordinating response efforts, communicating with stakeholders, mitigating the impact of the crisis, and maintaining organizational stability. It encompasses both pre-crisis planning and real-time response activities.\nAnalysis of Standards, Protocols, and Concepts\nBusiness Continuity (BC), Disaster Recovery (DR), and Crisis Management (CM) are critical components of organizational resilience, ensuring operations persist in the face of disruptions. Standards and protocols, such as ISO 22301 for BC and ISO 27001 for DR, provide frameworks for implementation. The standards emphasize risk assessment, business impact analysis, and the development of strategies to mitigate disruptions (Zgureanu, 2021). BC focuses on maintaining essential functions during and after a crisis, while DR is concerned with restoring IT infrastructure and data. CM encompasses broader organizational responses to crises, including communication, decision-making, and coordination.\nThe ISO 22301 standard for BC outlines the requirements for implementing, maintaining, and improving a Business Continuity Management System(BCMS). It emphasizes the importance of understanding an organizations context, identifying its key products and services, and assessing the impact of disruptions on these. BC plans are developed to ensure the continuity of operations, considering scenarios ranging from natural disasters to cyberattacks. Regular testing and exercises are conducted to validate these plans and identify areas for improvement.\nOn the other hand, ISO 27001 focuses on information security management systems (ISMS) and is crucial for DR planning (Zgureanu, 2021). DR involves the restoration of critical IT systems and data following a disruption. This includes backup and recovery procedures, alternative processing facilities, and arrangements for accessing vital records. The ISO 27001 standard provides guidelines for assessing risks to information security and implementing controls to mitigate these risks. It emphasizes the importance of data backup, redundancy, and access controls to ensure the availability and integrity of information during and after a disaster.\nIn addition to these standards, various concepts underpin BC, DR, and CM within organizations. These include the concept of resilience, which involves the ability to adapt and recover from disruptions quickly. Resilience is achieved through effective risk management, robust infrastructure, and agile response mechanisms. Another key concept is business impact analysis (BIA), which involves identifying critical processes and resources, assessing their vulnerabilities, and prioritizing recovery efforts accordingly (Păunescu et al., 2018). BIA informs the development of BC and DR plans, ensuring resources are allocated effectively to minimize downtime and financial losses.", "Understanding how Major Computer Incidents are Formally Investigated\nMajor computer incidents demand a thorough and structured investigation to identify the root causes, mitigate damage, and prevent future occurrences. Such investigations typically involve a multidisciplinary team comprising cybersecurity experts, forensic analysts, legal advisors, and sometimes representatives from relevant regulatory bodies. The process begins with establishing a clear incident response plan that outlines roles, responsibilities, and communication channels. Initial steps involve containment to prevent further damage, preservation of evidence, and assessment of the incidents scope and impact. Once contained, forensic tools such as network sniffers, disk imaging software, and memory analysis tools are employed to collect and analyze digital evidence (Sachdeva et al., 2020). The tools help identify the attack vector, compromised systems, and malicious activities. Additionally, data from security logs, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus reports are scrutinized to reconstruct the timeline of events leading up to the incident. Throughout the investigation, close coordination and communication among team members are essential to ensure the integrity of evidence and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. \nIn a major cyber-related investigation, evidence handling is important to its admissibility and effectiveness in legal proceedings. Evidence containment begins with isolating affected systems and securing volatile data to prevent tampering or loss. Disk imaging tools are used to create forensic copies of storage devices, preserving the original data while allowing investigators to work with duplicates. The images are then analyzed using specialized software to identify artifacts such as malware, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration (Doshi & Sharma, 2020). Furthermore, network traffic analysis helps trace the intrusions path and identify potential compromise points. A strict chain of custody is maintained throughout the investigation to track evidence handling and ensure its integrity. This involves documenting every step taken, from collection to analysis and presentation in court. Encryption and hashing techniques are employed to protect data integrity and authenticity. Once analyzed, the evidence is presented clearly and concisely, often through detailed reports and expert testimony.", "The criticism of enlightenment reason by Adorno and Horkheimer came about because it gave priority to instrumental reason that only emphasized its effectiveness and influence. Instrumental reason assumes everything related to nature and life, then switches to commodities for capitalist gain. Real creativity is stifled, and social exclusion is perpetuated by this way of thinking, which is typified by the cultural business. They contend that society becomes more commercialized and dehumanized in the end as a result of the enlightenment values of growth and rationality.\nThe criticism of Adorno and Horkheimer is based on the manner in which they saw how scientific positivism serves to further capitalist objectives. They claimed that scientific positivism was only interested in quantification and effectiveness for the pursuit of profit only. In such cases it ignores humanity and genuine innovation. In response, it employs scientific strategies in industrial manufacturing to boost operations, enhance productivity, and maximize profit. For this reason, they regard scientific positivism as a weapon that capitalism uses to maintain its hegemony and monetize every facet of existence.\nThe Homers Odyssey was used to serve as evidence for the crafty ways of science. The main response was that Odysseus is a prime example of instrumental reasons craftiness used. Odysseus uses cunning and strategy with the goal of outperforming nature and the elements on his voyage. Interestingly, this happens to be similar in the manner in which science also attempts to regulate and influence nature for human interests using instrumental reason. Science is in pursuit of control and making use of the natural environment for the growth of technology and the development of society, which is the same way Odysseus deceived his rivals.\nThey describe reification as the process of the transformation of things made by human into independent entities, fully separated from their original human context. Mimesis is the imitation of natural phenomena, while negation is the process of creating something other than the knowledge given directly. It is evident how it aligns with mimesis, whereby a person can imitate these real things and then use the aspect of negation to challenge them. One argument they put out is that cultural items are commoditized and reified by industrial manufacturing. Because of their commodification, people imitate these goods, which promotes uniformity. In an attempt to fight this transformed material and the danger it may bring to society, they highlighted the adoption of negation and called for thoughtful discussion.\nII) Short Essay\nA)\nFilm, according to Adorno and Horkheimer, encourages spectator passivity, which undermines intellect by making people use what they see. They argue that the culture industry, which includes cinema, produces predictable, uniform material that compels viewers to allow whatever is happening to continue. They kept mentioning that film hinders critical thinking and consideration amongst its consumers. They assert that the film business does not have the transformative ability to go against the capitalist system and uphold the status quo because it is fuelled by economic concerns, which standardize material, induce inactivity, and encourage conformity.\nB)\n\tPseudo-individualism was used to illustrate the erroneous sense of distinctiveness that standardized goods provided, a myth of personality perpetuated by the culture business. It makes those working in a condition that they cannot see how capitalism is negatively affecting them. To keep the populace oblivious to their enslavement, the industry has a well-organized strategy, like providing idyllic entertainment that encourages apathy and compliance to consumers. The culture business maintains the status quo by endorsing homogenized content and flimsy wants, which cover up structural inequalities and abuse while\xa0strengthening capitalist power systems.\nC)\n\tThey asserted that false projection is the manner in which society fears and vulnerabilities is pictured onto groups exploited, such as Jews and paranoia in connection with anti-Semitism. The normal act of scapegoating occurs when Jews, who are the oppressed in this case, are falsely held responsible for society issues due to paranoia that is exacerbated by societal concerns and uncertainty (Freyenhagen, 2020). To foster anti-Semitic sentiments, this plan of misleading projection diverts focus from the real problems experienced in society, which include social injustice and financial servitude.\nD)\n\tThe efficient and controlled nature of instrumental reason, according to Adorno and Horkheimer on “false projection,” breeds fear and creates inaccurate illusions about disadvantaged populations like Jews. This societal anxiety-driven paranoia takes a similar form of scapegoating, in which Jews are falsely held responsible for structural problems. Society uses instrumental reason to influence those in the surroundings, even after knowing that its need for power gives rise to unreasonable biases and phobias. As a result, Jews are singled out for these projections and used as easy scapegoats for more serious social issues. This theory draws attention away from the intrinsic problems with capitalism and rational ideas by highlighting how instrumental reason feeds into paranoia and anti-Semitic sentiments.\nIII)\nThey assert that the continuance of societal inequalities, such as racism and the mistreatment of nature, are the results of defective forms of Western subjectivity that are fashioned by instrumental reason. According to their argument, their want to rule nature originates from an urge to exert authority over the surroundings, mirroring a more generalized dominant attitude inherent in Western culture. Comparable to how those who are marginalized are seen as challenges to be overcome or subjugated, racism also arises as an expression of this instrumental reasoning. They\xa0suggest re-evaluating social standards and critically engaging with Enlightenment principles to correct these defective methods of subjectivity. They advocate against instrumental reason for a more dialectical strategy that welcomes uncertainty and complexities. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to promote compassion and cooperation as vital elements of a more equitable and healthy society, as well as to challenge oppressive power systems and deepen peoples knowledge of how humans and environment are intertwined.", "NNU: Empowering Healthcare Workers, Sapping Progress\nNational Nurses United (NNUs), a well-known US group, defends RNs and other healthcare workers.

To ensure the efficacy and compliance of the security plans, it is essential to integrate legal and political considerations seamlessly. Firstly, understanding the relevant laws and regulations about cybersecurity is important. This involves conducting thorough research to identify laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, which dictate how data is handled and protected. Incorporating the above regulations into the security audit plan ensures that the networks security measures align with legal requirements.\nSecondly, it is vital to consider the political landscape, especially in regions where geopolitical tensions may impact cybersecurity. Notably, this involves assessing potential threats arising from state-sponsored cyber-attacks or regulatory changes influenced by political agendas (Hussain, 2024). Security plans can be adjusted to mitigate risks and adapt to evolving circumstances by staying informed about geopolitical developments.\nThirdly, it is crucial to establish clear protocols for handling sensitive information in compliance with legal standards. This includes implementing encryption techniques, access controls, and data retention policies to safeguard confidential data and ensure regulatory compliance (Duggineni, 2023). Regular audits should be conducted to assess these measures effectiveness and identify potential areas of vulnerability.\nMoreover, fostering collaboration with relevant government agencies and industry regulatory bodies enhances the security audit process. Engaging with these stakeholders provides valuable insights into emerging threats, best practices, and regulatory updates that may impact the networs security posture. Organizations can proactively address compliance issues and mitigate risks by maintaining open lines of communication with regulatory authorities.", "Leveraging Soil Microorganisms to Combat Climate Change\nIntroduction\nThe report summarizes a two-day workshop titled “Soil Microbial Strategies for Climate Mitigation” that was held in Las Vegas, Nevada, 14 - 16th of February 2024. The workshop brought together world leading experts including artists, researchers and policy writers from different fields of climate science, soil ecology, microbial and plant ecology to share their insights on soil microbial strategies to mitigate climate change.  The workshop focused on exploring non-GMO microbiome solutions as biofertilizers to enhance soil and plant health for CO2 drawdown and soil carbon stabilization through plant photosynthesis and soil microbial activities. In-depth discussions highlighted different innovative approaches such as creating beneficial microbial consortia (SynCom), and enriching naturally occurring microbial community members of importance for plant and soil health. These advancements were explored across diverse applications including precision agriculture, regenerative agriculture, wild land management, and soil restoration efforts targeting varying degrees of soil degradation.  Recognizing the extensive soil erosion globally, driven by agricultural practices, industrial activities, land exploitation, and exacerbated by climate change, meeting participants call for urgent action to avert a catastrophic loss of vital life forms, including humanity.\nSoil Microbiome, Soil Health and Mitigations\nAdvancing Knowledge\nThe workshop impressed on the need to understand the intricate relationship between the soil microbiome and soil health is crucial for sustainable agriculture. The soil microbiome comprises a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses, which interact with each other and with plants in complex ways. These microorganisms play vital roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, disease suppression, and soil structure formation. Previous research has concentrated on leveraging beneficial microorganisms to enhance soil productivity and health. These microbes aid in plant growth by facilitating nutrient uptake, producing helpful substances like antibiotics and hormones, and fostering symbiotic relationships with plant roots in the rhizosphere (see figure 1). Their activities include nutrient mineralization, fixation, mobilization, and solubilization, as well as the release of growth-promoting compounds (Canarini et al., 2021; 5308).\n\n\nFigure 1: soil conservation cycle\nRecent advancements in sequencing technology, such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, have revolutionized our ability to study the soil microbiome. These technologies allow researchers to characterize microbial communities and their functional genes at unprecedented scales and depths. Through metagenomic analysis, scientists can identify specific microbial taxa and their metabolic pathways, shedding light on their contributions to soil processes. These advancements in sequencing technology have significantly broadened our understanding of the soil microbiome and its various applications (Liang et al., 2020). Experts in focused group discussions have highlighted that crucial microorganisms within the soil microbiome can now be identified, isolated, and harnessed for the development of biofertilizers.\nResearch efforts are now focused on elucidating how microbial diversity and composition influence soil health and productivity (Figure 2). Studies have shown that diverse microbial communities are associated with enhanced soil fertility, improved nutrient availability, and better plant growth. Moreover, certain microbial groups, such as mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, form symbiotic relationships with plants, providing them with essential nutrients and increasing their resilience to environmental stressors. It was appreciated that in literature soil microbiome performs countless functions that directly or indirectly impact human, plant, animal, and soil health (Fawzy et al., 2020; 2093). Specifically, managing soil ensures the promotion of ecological integrity and long-term fertility of agricultural lands. Moving forward, strategies to monitor soil health using chemical, physical, and biological indicators, alongside harnessing beneficial microorganisms for bio-fertilizer formulations deemed feasible in promoting sustainable agriculture.\n\n\nFigure 2: Soil health network\nPractical Applications\nInsights gained from research on the soil microbiome offer significant practical implications for agricultural practices. Farmers and land managers can adopt strategies that support microbial diversity and activity to promote soil health and sustainability. Reduced tillage practices, such as conservation tillage, have demonstrated efficacy in preserving soil microbial communities by minimizing disruption to soil structure and organic matter, thereby maintaining microbial habitats and promoting the retention of soil carbon and nutrients. These thoughts align with a study that emphasized the importance of agricultural practices that foster microbial activity in the soil to maintain its resilience and overall health for agricultural purposes (Shahzad et al., 2021; 14221). Additionally, agroforestry, integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, enriches soil microbial diversity and function. Trees contribute organic matter through leaf litter and root exudates, fostering symbiotic relationships between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, which further enhance nutrient cycling and soil aggregation (see figure 3).\nCover cropping serves as an effective management practice to enhance soil microbiome diversity and function, with crops like legumes and grasses contributing organic matter, weed suppression, and improved soil structure while hosting diverse microbial communities in their root systems. Concurrently, the development of regional probiotic inoculants tailored to local soil conditions shows promise for sustaining native microbial communities and supporting agricultural sustainability. These inoculants, comprising beneficial microorganisms adapted to specific soil types and climates were envisaged to boost soil fertility, counteract pathogens, and increase crop yields, thus presenting a customized approach to enhancing agricultural productivity while safeguarding soil health (Bardgett & Caruso, 2020; 112). Such strategies, leveraging the soil microbiome, offer pathways for advancing sustainable agriculture through nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition, marking a significant trajectory in shaping the future of agricultural practices.\n\nFigure 3: Interplay of microbial interactions\nCarbon sequestration and soil\nInnovative Strategies\nInnovative farming practices such as agroforestry and biochar application are emerging as promising methods to not only enhance soil carbon storage but also promote soil conservation. Agroforestry, which involves integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, offers a holistic approach to carbon sequestration. Trees contribute organic matter to the soil through leaf litter and root exudates, enriching it with carbon compounds and fostering symbiotic relationships with soil microbes (Figure 4). This not only sequesters carbon but also improves soil structure and nutrient retention, enhancing fertility and resilience to environmental stresses (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2021; 736). Similarly, the use of biochar, a stable form of carbon produced through organic material pyrolysis, presents an innovative strategy for both carbon sequestration and soil conservation. By incorporating biochar into the soil, it acts as a long-term carbon sink, effectively trapping carbon for extended periods while enhancing soil water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity (Canarini et al., 2021; 5308). This dual benefit contributes significantly to soil health and productivity, aligning with soil conservation objectives.\n\n\nFigure 4: carbon sequestration in nature\nAdditionally, exploring the cultivation of deep-rooted perennials holds promise for long-term carbon sequestration and soil conservation. These plants, with their extensive root systems, facilitate the accumulation of carbon deep within the soil profile, offering a sustainable approach to mitigating climate change and improving soil quality. Its important to recognize that soils play a vital role in maintaining a balanced global carbon cycle, with carbon sequestration occurring through the photosynthesis process. As plants assimilate carbon, a portion is retained in the soil, highlighting the intrinsic link between carbon sequestration and soil conservation agendas (Sangiorgio et al., 2020; 794). By integrating these innovative farming practices, we can effectively address both carbon sequestration and soil conservation challenges, ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of our agricultural landscapes.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nDespite the potential benefits of these innovative strategies, accurately measuring soil carbon sequestration remains a significant challenge. Soil carbon dynamics are influenced by various factors, including soil type, climate, land management practices, and microbial activity, leading to considerable spatial and temporal variability. For example, the use of nitrogen fertilizer can increase soil organic matter but may also lead to nitrogen runoff into water bodies, posing ecological risks (Shahzad et al., 2021; 14231). It was noted that developing standardized metrics and monitoring methods for soil carbon sequestration is imperative to accurately assess the effectiveness of these strategies and inform decision-making. Efforts are underway to establish long-term monitoring programs that integrate field measurements with advanced modeling techniques, aiming to validate model predictions and provide ground-truthing of soil carbon dynamics. Collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and land managers is essential to address these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented by innovative carbon sequestration strategies. By overcoming measurement hurdles and harnessing the potential of emerging agricultural practices, society can advance towards sustainable land management practices that enhance soil health, mitigate climate change, and ensure food security for future generations. \nSustainable Agriculture and Ecosystem Services\nAgroecology and Regenerative Practices\nAgroecology and regenerative agricultural practices emerged as focal points during the meeting, reflecting a growing recognition of the importance of ecological principles in sustainable agriculture. The adoption of these practices represents a paradigm shift towards more holistic approaches that prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience. Intercropping and crop rotation, for instance, were highlighted as effective strategies for diversifying agricultural landscapes and enhancing soil fertility. Globally, there is increasing interest in evaluating the scientific evidence supporting the ecological significance of regenerative agriculture compared to conventional methods (Bardgett & Caruso, 2020; 112). Forward looking insights emphasize the importance of integrating regenerative and agroecology practices to incorporate ecological principles into agricultural systems. By planting different crops together or in sequence, farmers can reduce pest and disease pressure, improve nutrient cycling, and enhance overall ecosystem function. These practices mimic natural ecosystems, where diverse plant communities support a multitude of interactions and services, ultimately leading to greater agricultural productivity and resilience (see figure 5).\nNatural pest control methods also featured prominently in discussions on agroecology and regenerative practices. By encouraging the presence of beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and predatory wasps, farmers can reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides while maintaining pest populations at manageable levels. The experts endeared intercropping and crop rotation as vital regenerative practices for sustainable agriculture, particularly in areas with degraded soils. Intercropping involves cultivating multiple crops simultaneously, reducing water and land demand while promoting soil health and sustainability. It enhances economic yield balance, stabilizes crop yields, and optimizes resource utilization, benefiting from complementary resource use among plants. Additionally, intercropping maintains soil water, enhances microbial activity, and fixes nitrogen for crops. Similarly, crop rotation, the practice of changing crop types annually, offers numerous benefits such as improving soil health, nutrient cycling, and pest control. It conserves, maintains, and replenishes soil resources like nitrogen and organic matter, enhancing soil fertility and productivity over time. Crop rotation also improves microbial properties, mitigating fertility loss and promoting soil structure modification for increased productivity.\n\n\nFigure 5: Regeration of soil through agricultural activities\nConserving Biodiversity\nExperts agree with the notion that the conservation of biodiversity within agricultural systems stands as a fundamental strategy for enhancing ecosystem resilience, productivity, and sustainability. At the heart of this endeavor lies the soil, an intricate ecosystem teeming with a myriad of life forms, each playing a crucial role in vital ecosystem functions. From the retention of soil water to the cycling of organic matter and the sequestration of carbon, the soil serves as a dynamic reservoir of life and nutrients. Recognizing the intricate interplay between soil biodiversity and ecosystem health, experts emphasize the pivotal importance of nurturing natural habitats, promoting diverse plantings, and safeguarding local genetic resources within agricultural landscapes. Regenerative agricultural practices, such as the implementation of diverse crop rotations, cover cropping initiatives, and the cultivation of varied pastures, are championed for their ability to bolster aboveground biodiversity while fostering robust net primary productivity and facilitating carbon sequestration below the soil surface.\nFurthermore, it is was  found imperative to acknowledge the indispensable role of soil microbial communities in shaping both plant diversity and soil vitality. These microscopic organisms wield significant influence over critical soil variables, modulating nutrient availability and facilitating essential biochemical processes. Through the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices that nurture and harness the power of soil microbiomes, we can unlock a plethora of production and environmental benefits while nurturing biodiversity within agricultural ecosystems. This emphasis on increasing plant diversity within pastures not only stimulates the proliferation of beneficial fungi, aiding in carbon sequestration efforts, but also underscores the pressing need for future research endeavors to delve deeper into the synergistic relationships between plant diversity and other regenerative agricultural practices. It was argued that embracing a holistic approach to biodiversity conservation within agricultural systems, soil stakeholder not only bolster ecosystem services such as pollination and pest control but also unlock a multitude of benefits for farmers and communities alike. From enhanced soil health and water quality to fortified food security, improved nutrition, and the preservation of cultural heritage, prioritizing biodiversity conservation stands as an essential cornerstone for ensuring the sustained productivity, environmental integrity, and overall well-being of agricultural landscapes in the face of ever-evolving challenges.\nStakeholder Engagement and Policy\nStakeholder engagement in soil health initiatives stands as a cornerstone for advancing sustainable agriculture, leveraging the collective expertise and resources of various actors including private companies, donors, NGOs, governments, local farmers, researchers, and policymakers. Through multi-stakeholder partnerships, these entities can collaborate to develop agricultural value chains and foster food system sustainability on a global scale. However, despite the recognition of collaborations importance, existing partnerships have not fully realized their potential in achieving sustainable agricultural outcomes. The soil experts and policy writers highlighted the urgent need for improved collaborative governance effectiveness to ensure the equitable and sustainable management of natural resources. Central to this effort is the active engagement of local farmers, who possess invaluable firsthand knowledge and contextual understanding of local conditions, making them pivotal actors in implementing soil health management strategies. By engaging in participatory research and extension activities, farmers can co-create knowledge and tailor best practices to suit specific agroecological contexts, ultimately facilitating the adoption of sustainable agricultural methods. Through collaborative partnerships and enhanced understanding among stakeholders, the agriculture sector can overcome common challenges, promote knowledge sharing, and drive the widespread adoption of sustainable practices for the benefit of both people and the planet.\nFrom a policy makers perspective, collaborative workshops and partnerships stood out as crucial avenues for integrating sustainable agriculture principles into both sustainable and regenerative agricultural approaches. Experts recognized the pivotal role of stakeholder engagement and impressed that active participation from various stakeholders is essential for effective policy development in support of sustainable agriculture. A clear consensus exists regarding the importance of developing supportive incentives and policies to promote sustainable land and soil conservation, acknowledging the critical role of these resources in maintaining agricultural productivity and environmental health. Moreover, emphasis on the vital roles of ecosystem services cannot be overstated, as these services are indispensable for supporting the well-being of farmers, plants, and animals. Policies aimed at protecting and enhancing ecosystem services were prioritized to ensure the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems. Additionally, stakeholders were to actively fulfill their roles in supporting and developing clear policies that drive the widespread adoption of beneficial agricultural practices. This comprehensive approach is essential for fostering resilient and regenerative agricultural systems that benefit both ecosystems and society as a whole, while simultaneously providing farmers and land managers with necessary tools for transitioning to sustainable systems. Access to education, training, and resources is crucial for enabling stakeholders to implement sustainable practices effectively, thereby ensuring the long-term health and productivity of our soils and ecosystems.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nWhile progress has been made in promoting sustainable agriculture and soil health, several challenges and opportunities were identified during the round table discusssions. One key challenge is the need for improved measurement and monitoring of soil health indicators, including soil organic carbon, microbial diversity, and nutrient cycling processes. Standardized metrics and monitoring methods are essential for accurately assessing soil health status, tracking changes over time, and evaluating the effectiveness of management interventions. Additionally, addressing barriers to adoption, such as lack of access to information, technical support, and financial resources, is critical for mainstreaming sustainable agricultural practices and overcoming inertia in conventional farming systems.\nDespite these challenges, the worshop observed significant opportunities for innovation and collaboration in the field of sustainable agriculture and soil health. Advances in digital technologies, data analytics, and precision agriculture offer new tools and approaches for optimizing resource use, minimizing environmental impacts, and enhancing agricultural productivity.

By harnessing these opportunities and overcoming challenges through collective action and strategic investments, stakeholders can accelerate the transition towards a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable food system for future generations.\n\nThought-Provoking Advances\nPrecision Agriculture\nPrecision agriculture stands as a revolutionary breakthrough in modern agricultural methodologies, harnessing cutting-edge technologies to optimize soil health management and resource allocation (Naylor et al., 2020; 28). The workshop convened by experts underscored the pivotal role of precision agriculture in bolstering agricultural sustainability, emphasizing the integration of data-driven technologies and precision farming techniques. By leveraging tools such as GPS-guided machinery, sensor technologies, and remote sensing imagery, farmers are empowered to conduct thorough assessments of soil conditions, enabling precise customization of management practices. This tailored approach not only minimizes resource wastage, such as excessive fertilizer application, but also maximizes crop productivity and enhances soil health.\nMoreover, the workshop elucidated the multifaceted benefits of precision agriculture, extending beyond soil health enhancement to encompass environmental impact mitigation and adaptation to climate variability. Through precise mapping of soil nutrient levels and moisture content, farmers can devise site-specific management strategies, optimizing inputs while mitigating environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (Singh et al., 2023; 15). Additionally, the adoption of precision irrigation systems plays a crucial role in curtailing water wastage and preserving freshwater resources, thereby contributing to overall ecosystem health. The workshops discussions underscored the transformative potential of precision agriculture in reshaping soil health management practices and promoting sustainable agricultural intensification amidst the complex challenges posed by climate change and resource scarcity. It is paramount for stakeholders to embrace and champion these innovative practices to pave the way for resilient and sustainable food systems for future generations.\nSoil Health Metrics and Models\nThe discourse surrounding soil health metrics and models, as elucidated during the workshop, underscored the critical imperative for the development and implementation of standardized methodologies applicable across diverse ecological landscapes and agricultural contexts. Central to this discussion was the recognition of soil as a dynamic and multifaceted ecosystem, wherein the interplay of various factors such as organic matter content, microbial biodiversity, and nutrient cycling intricately shape its health and functionality. Experts emphasized the paramount importance of comprehensive soil health indicators, advocating for a holistic approach that transcends conventional assessments to encompass a broader spectrum of soil attributes and ecological processes (see figure 6). By establishing standardized metrics that encapsulate the intricate nuances of soil health dynamics, stakeholders can foster a more nuanced understanding of soil ecosystems, enabling informed decision-making and targeted interventions aimed at enhancing soil resilience and productivity (Sangiorgio et al., 2020; 766).\nFurthermore, the meeting accentuated the imperative of advancing modeling methodologies to accurately capture intricate soil-plant-microbe interactions and ecosystem dynamics. By assimilating data from diverse sources including field experiments, remote sensing, and microbial sequencing, sophisticated models can furnish actionable insights into the underlying mechanisms steering soil health variations (Sangiorgio et al., 2020; 794). Additionally, stakeholders underscored the significance of crafting user-friendly soil health assessment tools tailored to diverse end-users, including farmers, extension agents, and policymakers. Widening access to such tools empowers stakeholders to embrace evidence-based management practices, thereby fostering the promotion of soil health on a broader scale and advancing the sustainability of agricultural systems.\n\n\nFigure 6: Soil conservation model cycle\nRegenerative Agriculture\nRegenerative agriculture took center stage during the meeting, drawing attention to its transformative potential in restoring ecosystem functions, bolstering soil health, and combating climate change. deliberations emphasized the significance of adopting adaptive management approaches, stressing the need for continuous learning and experimentation to refine regenerative practices. This iterative process allows stakeholders to tailor solutions to specific contexts, integrating the principles of regenerative agriculture with local socio-economic and environmental factors (Fawzy et al., 2020; 2071). At its core, regenerative agriculture aims to reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity, ultimately improving the water cycle and facilitating carbon drawdown.\nMoreover, the workshop noted the importance of addressing barriers hindering the widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture. Key challenges included limited access to technical knowledge, financial resources, and supportive policies. To overcome these obstacles, capacity-building initiatives must be prioritized, providing farmers with the necessary training and extension services to embrace regenerative practices (Malik et al., 2019; 8). Additionally, the development of market incentives and certification programs can incentivize broader adoption throughout agricultural supply chains. By fostering collaboration among farmers, researchers, and extension agents, a collective effort can identify and implement effective strategies that promote sustainable land management practices. This collaborative approach not only enhances the resilience of agricultural systems but also fosters ecological sustainability and contributes to global efforts in addressing climate change.\nSustainability Statement\nThe recent meeting convened with a resounding affirmation of the indispensable role that sustainable soil management plays in safeguarding our planets health and ensuring the prosperity of generations to come. Highlighting the urgency of the matter, discussions centered on initiatives prioritizing biodiversity preservation, carbon sequestration, and the widespread adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. These efforts were acknowledged as integral to nurturing ecosystems and communities resilient to the challenges of an ever-changing environment. Emphasizing a collaborative approach, participants stressed the necessity of concerted action uniting researchers, farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders from diverse sectors. Through such collective endeavors, grounded in scientific rigor and inclusive engagement, the meeting envisioned a future where evidence-based practices pave the way for enduring change, securing the vitality of our soils and the broader environment for generations to come.\nBy championing science-based solutions and fostering broad-based collaboration, the meeting concluded, humanity can lay the groundwork for a sustainable future.

Looking ahead, fostering collaboration among stakeholders and implementing supportive policies will be paramount in driving the adoption of sustainable soil management practices globally. By prioritizing these efforts, we can strive towards building more resilient ecosystems and communities while effectively tackling pressing environmental challenges.", "The City and State where it is located \nThe Date \n\nAssignment \nQuestion 1- Lecture Notes\nDistinguish between primary, secondary and delegated legislations.\nPrimary legislation, also referred to as statutes, defines the main laws passed by the legislative bodies of the UK, including the UK Parliament, Welsh Parliament, Scottish Parliament, and the Northern Ireland Assembly (UK Parliament 2019). Primary legislation includes Acts passed in historical parliaments, Church of England Measures, and other primary legislation for Northern Ireland. The collection of these legislations can be referred to with the term ‘The Statute Book.’ \nAs created by Parliament, primary legislation acts as a unifying bond for the entire nation and is the most important source of law within the UK since it is the law of the land. The two types of primary legislation are public general acts and local (personal acts) (Course material 4). A public general act is a law passed by the UK Parliament that applies to the general population. An instance of a public general act is the Human Rights Act 1998 (Course material 4). A local or personal act is an act of law that impacts a specific individual, body or locality. For instance, laws on harbours, canals and railways. \nOn the other hand, secondary legislation, also referred to as subordinate legislation, is delegated legislation formulated by a body or person under authority from primary legislation (an Act of Parliament) (UK Parliament 2019). In most cases, powers to formulate secondary legislation may be deliberated on the Crown, ministers, or public bodies. For instance, the Office of Communications (OFCOM) obtains these powers from the Communications Act 2003. Types of secondary legislation include Statutory Rules and Orders, Church Instruments, and Statutory Instruments. In this way, Secondary legislation becomes a time-effective method that allows for the implementation of new elements of an Act of Parliament without the need to undergo the entire process of creating a new Act of Parliament. \nDelegated legislation is similar to secondary legislation and is a statutory instrument. Therefore, Secondary legislation can be elaborated as law created by ministers or other bodies due to their under powers granted by Acts of Parliament. This type of legislation can be used to add amendments to existing laws or to set the pace for when an Act of Parliament will be implemented (Course material 4). For instance, in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, secondary legislation was adopted to implement new banned substances in (accordance with newly discovered research on substance control).\nExplain the hierarchy within statutory sources and the case law.\nThe hierarchy within statutory sources in the UK is based on the legal system’s core principle of parliamentary sovereignty. This means the Parliament is the supreme legal ruling body (Clegg et al. 2016). Therefore, the hierarchy of legal sources that govern the law and statutory law are primary and secondary legislation. Primary legislation is the main and highest form of law passed by the UK parliament. Acts of Parliament formulate new laws, repeal old ones, or amend existing ones (Clegg et al. 2016). Next in line is secondary legislation, a law formulated by a body or individual under authority from an Act of Parliament. These include Statutory Rules and Orders, Church Instruments, and Statutory Instruments.\nThe hierarchy of common law entails common law and precedent. Common law refers to judge-made law derived from historical customs and case decisions. Common law is rooted in the decisions made in previous cases as guidance for similar cases in the future (Clegg et al. 2016). On the other hand, the doctrine of precedent requires courts to follow decisions made by courts higher in the hierarchy. Under this precedent, the UK court structure was created, with the Supreme Court as the highest in the hierarchy and responsible for setting binding precedents for lower courts. \nExplain the impact of the Human Rights Act.\nThe Human Rights Act passed in 1998 as a UK law created an avenue for individuals to defend their rights in UK courts. It is also responsible for driving public organisations like the police, local councils and the Government to treat every individual equally, with dignity, respect and fairness (Liberty 2019). Fulfilling this helps achieve its overall aim of bringing people’s rights in the UK closer to them and providing them an avenue to claim their rights in UK courts rather than having to follow up cases in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (Liberty 2019). Lastly, the Human Rights Act ensures that when people’s rights have been infringed or put at risk, they have adequate avenues to pursue those cases. \nAnalyse the tension between secondary legislation and the principle of separation of power.\nThe principle of separation of powers denotes that the three principal institutions of the state, the executive, legislature, and judiciary, must be divided into functions and persons to ensure the safeguarding of liberties and protection against tyranny (The British Institute of Human Rights n.d.).  This means that each branch of state has specific and separate functions and powers. Secondary legislation is delegated legislation formulated by a body or person under authority from primary legislation (an Act of Parliament). The tension between these two concepts arises from the concern about the concentration of executive and legislative powers within the same branch of state (The British Institute of Human Rights n.d.). This is deemed to undermine the balance and fairness intended in the separation of power since the line is blurred between the functions of the executive and legislative branches. \nThis analysis can be viewed in the following aspects: the executive outreach explores the function of the executive to formulate secondary legislation, which gives the branch significant power. This power can be misused if not checked or kept under control (The British Institute of Human Rights n.d.). Additionally, the deliberation of executive and legislative powers by select individuals or agencies raises concerns about accountability. Secondly, the ineffectiveness of judicial review due to the inability of the judiciary to successfully review the legality of government actions causes complex legal challenges to the separation of power. \nIllustrate the operation of literal, golden and purposive rules of statutory interpretation.\nUnder the literal rule of statutory interpretation, the judge considers what the statute actually says rather than what it might mean.  For the judge to achieve this, they have to give the words and terms in the statute a literal meaning. A literal meaning of a term, in this case, is its plain, everyday meaning (Okur 2021). The reading of the literal meaning is done even though this interpretation could be deemed undesirable or unjust. This rule stipulates that the intention of the Parliament is best sourced from the natural and ordinary meaning of words used. \nThe golden rule operates as a variation of the literal rule. It operates in the event that applying the literal rule leads to an absurdity (Okur 2021). The court must opt for an alternative meaning of the words to eliminate the absurdity. \nLastly, the purposive rule approach is the most recent approach in which the court seeks to find the gap in the old law and derive a possible meaning of what the Parliament meant (Okur 2021).\nAnalyse the structure of the criminal and civil courts.\nIn the UK, the criminal and civil court systems are separate. Civil courts deal with civil cases involving individual disputes, tort claims, property disputes, and contract violations. Most housing cases also fall into this category. The hierarchical structure of these courts is as follows: the Supreme Court serves as the highest appellate court for all civil cases across the UK (Shelter England 2023). Next is the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), which reviews appeals from the High Court and County Court. The High Court is next subdivided into the Queen’s Bench Division, Chancery Division, and Family Division. This level of court handles more complex judicial reviews and civil cases (Shelter England 2023). Lastly, the County Court which deals with broad-spectrum civil disputes. In addition to this hierarchy, the civil courts in the UK also incorporate specialist courts and tribunals like the Property Chamber and the Employment Tribunal.\nThe criminal courts in the UK handle a range of offences, from minor ones to severe crimes. The hierarchy of the courts is as follows: the Supreme Court, which is ultimately responsible for all criminal cases across Northern Ireland, Wales and England (Shelter England 2023). Next is the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), which reviews sentences and convictions passed by the Crown Court. The Crown Court presides over serious criminal cases by a judge or judge and jury (Shelter England 2023). Last is the Magistrate Court, which deals with processing preliminary hearings, selecting civil law matters, and less serious criminal cases.\nIn considering Criminal Courts, the Magistrate Court or the Crown Court is adopted. These two are trial courts. Magistrate Courts are responsible for hearing all criminal cases but pass the more serious cases to the Crown Court (Course material 3). Lay Magistrates do the criminal cases heard in the Magistrate Court, not a judge or jury. Lay Magistrates are responsible for delivering the guilty verdict and the sentence to a suspect for all minor offences. \n\n\nAnalyse the role of the Judiciary and the judicial appointment process.\nThe core function of the Judiciary in the UK is to interpret and apply the law. In this, the Judiciary ensures that justice is served impartially and fairly, safeguarding all peoples rights and appraising the legality of decisions and actions performed by public agencies or officials (The Constitution Society n.d.). In this case, the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, deals with the most crucial cases that impact the government-public relationship. This role ensures that the government, constitution, or other institutions maintain a positive and healthy relationship with the public (The Constitution Society n.d.). Lastly, the Judiciary, in all its operations, seeks to ensure the public maintains and builds strong trust in the nation’s legal system. \nThe process by which judges are appointed in the UK is of significant constitutional importance. This process represents the UK’s long-standing tradition of judicial independence (The Constitution Society n.d.). Additionally, since the appointment process is based on open competition, it encourages diversity from the range of individuals who offer themselves for selection.  \nAnalyse the function of the jury in criminal trials.\nThe jury comprises 12 lay persons not legally trained to sit and hear the criminal cases. The main role of a jury in criminal trials is to listen to the evidence presented by both sides in the case. With this information, the jury is responsible for determining whether the defendant is guilty of the charges (Rule of Law Education Centre 2022). This role also requires them to consider the facts properly, the mitigating factors of the case, the evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimonies of witnesses (Rule of Law Education Centre 2022). The jury must be present to listen to the trials to gather this information. The jury can also seek clarification from the judge on points of law so that judges can determine the law. In civil cases, a jury decides how much damages should be awarded.\nAnalyse parliamentary and governmental efforts to widen access to the legal profession.\nCurrently, access to the legal profession is dependent on subjective judgment rather than concrete quantifiable criteria. This has caused an imbalance in access to the profession. Therefore, parliamentary and governmental efforts have been made to improve and widen access to the legal profession (Selita 2019). For instance, the government has offered training and pupillages on quantifiable criteria for access to the legal profession, which can help improve the outcomes and promote justice. Another governmental effort is providing financial support to students pursuing the profession (Selita 2019). This helps eliminate the significant financial barrier, especially among low-income areas and improves access to the legal profession. Also, introducing education and outreach programs to support academic projects and initiatives can help make the profession more enjoyable and improve access to it. \nThe parliamentary efforts are similarly significant. Introducing diversity and inclusion policies has enhanced diversity in the Bar by encouraging individuals from non-traditional backgrounds to join (Selita 2019). This helps enhance diversity in the profession and promotes fairness. Similarly, researching the experiences of students training to be on the Bar can help eradicate beliefs of discrimination, especially among the black ethnicity minority, disabled individuals, and women (Selita 2019). This approach has helped improve the accessibility and acceptability of the profession. \nAssess the duty and powers of the police.\nThe duty of the police in the UK is to protect life and property by detecting and preventing crimes (GOV.UK 2022). Under this duty lies the powers of the police, which include the following: Police officers have the power to arrest any individual who has committed an offence, is in the act of committing one or is about to commit one (GOV.UK 2022). This power extends to individuals suspected of involvement in an offence. \nAdditionally, police investigative powers involve collecting evidence on identified suspects and facilitating fair and effective trials in all cases. Their powers to prevent crimes lie in their responsibility to deter anti-social behaviour, manage suspects and offenders, and preserve public peace and order (GOV.UK 2022). Lastly, police powers involve the disposition of criminals by charging them with the crimes for prosecution.\nAssess the role of the Crown Prosecution Service.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is a body that makes independent decisions separate from the Government and the police. It independently prosecutes criminal cases that the police and other investigative organisations in Wales and England have investigated (Course material 3). By doing so, the CPS aims to ensure the right person is prosecuted for the right offence, serving justice where needed (CPS n.d.). This role involves deciding what cases should be prosecuted, preparing and presenting them to court, presenting information and support to victims and witnesses from the prosecution, advising police in early investigation stages, and analysing and determining the most appropriate charges for each crime. \nThe Crown Prosecution Service is also the body responsible for proving an offence of murder. Under this, the standard of proof refers to the level of proof the prosecution must prove for the case to be proved in court (Course material 3). The level is beyond reasonable doubt. This means that there is no doubt surrounding the person’s guilt. If any doubt exists surrounding the person’s guilt, the person will have to be found not guilty. On the other hand, the burden of proof denotes that the party responsible for proving their case in a criminal court is the prosecution. In this, the defence has no burden of proof and is not required to say anything to prove what they are saying is true. \nExamine the latest reforms to the civil justice process.\nThe latest reforms in the UK civil justice system have been aimed at enhancing the quality of justice services and modernising the operations to improve effectiveness, enhance efficiency and boost accessibility and fairness (Lissett 2024). Some of these reforms include procedural reforms, legal aid reforms, civil justice review, digitisation, and online courts. \nThe legal aid reforms that have been introduced have included additional legal funding and a change in the eligibility of individuals to receive this kind of aid. A reform of eligibility for legal aid has helped accommodate individuals who cannot afford legal representation (Lissett 2024). This helps ensure fairness and justice services are available to all without bias. \nSimilarly, case management reforms and procedural enhancements have been adopted to improve the management of cases as they pass through the legal system (Lissett 2024). In addition, procedural reforms have been introduced to streamline services within the justice system and encourage the settlement of disputes using alternative peaceful methods. \nLastly, the digitisation and introduction of online services have helped reduce issues of overcrowding and understaffing in public defence offices (Lissett 2024). The digitisation of some services ensures the public has better access to justice. \nCompare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of the different types of alternative dispute resolution.\nIn most cases, Alternative Dispute Resolutions (ADR) are less time-consuming and less expensive alternatives to solving conflicts. These reforms create avenues for people to achieve justice without going through courts. These reforms in the UK Parliament have created new opportunities for people to access mediation as an ADR to resolve disputes out of the court process (Conway 2022). With this reform, the justice system and the UK government intend to integrate the mediation process as a core step in resolving small civil claims (valued up to £10,000). \n Mediation is a confidential process involving an independent third party that facilitates the resolution of disputes between parties and reaching an agreement. In the role of a mediator, their solution cannot be imposed on the parties; instead, agreement should be reached by consent (Conway 2022). In this case, the mediation process will involve affected parties engaging in a free hour-long telephone conversation with a professional mediator. Mediators for these cases will be offered by HM Courts and Tribunals (Conway 2022). This reform will be supported by the Small Claims Mediation Service to recruit and train skilled mediators. \nMediation is an effective ADR in events when emotions are high, and the conflicting parties have a relationship to maintain. In this case, the mediator helps the parties manoeuvre their emotions and preserve their relationships (Conway 2022). Additionally, mediation is a cost and time-effective process compared to litigation since it does not involve any court proceedings. \nHowever, one drawback of mediation is that parties do not have any legal protection. Also, mediators lack the capacity to compel the production of evidence or information to ensure they are facts. Lastly, mediation might be ineffective for parties who want clarification from litigation. \nThe arbitration process is a time-effective and flexible ADR since it allows parties to choose arbitrators. Arbitration as an ADR involves an independent third party evaluating a dispute between parties (Conway 2022). An arbitrator is responsible for considering all arguments, facts, and evidence on both sides and deciding on the dispute. Although mediation is cost-friendly, arbitration can be a lengthy and costly ADR, especially in cases that require multiple hearings and expert witness input (Conway 2022). The process might also not be effective for disputes that involve one defendant and one claimant and will require summarising in court.\nAn Ombudsman as ADR is an independent service that assists consumers in resolving complaints they might have with a company (Conway 2022). Ombudsman services are also referred to as ADR schemes and combine adjudication, mediation and fact-finding processes. \nUnder consumer protection, the following processes can be adopted: conciliation and adjudication. Conciliation is a process similar to mediation, but the neutral third party is more active in offering suggestions on how a resolution can be reached (Conway 2022). Adjudication, on the other hand, is similar to arbitration. The advantage of this form of ADR is that it is free, fair, and impartial and results in the determination of unique and just decisions (Conway 2022). However, the process ends with a decision binding to the business, not the consumer. \nNegotiation is a process that involves two parties attempting to reach an agreement over a dispute. The negotiation process is the most informal and flexible ADR option, and like mediation, this process lacks legal formality, and the terms discussed may not be enforceable in a court. A drawback of negotiation is that the power imbalance and lack of a neutral party can disadvantage weaker parties, making the process unjust or stall altogether. Despite these drawbacks, negotiation is a confidential and direct process that puts the entire control of conflict resolution in the hands of the affected parties. \nAnalyse social, political and economic causes of miscarriages of justice.\nMiscarriages of justice refer to instances where the outcome of a judicial proceeding is improper and unfair. Mainly, it occurs when an individual is tried, convicted and punished for a crime they did not commit (Zellick 2010). The causes of miscarriages of justice can be categorised into social, political and economic factors, as discussed below.\nThe social causes of miscarriages of justice include social status, media influence, ethnicity, and race. Individuals from minority groups like Black communities or low-income households are at a high risk of facing challenges with access to quality legal representation and fair, just trials (Zellick 2010). This raises the chances of experiencing inadequate defence, false evidence or witness statements. Similarly, stereotyping and racial profiling due to media influence and public perceptions lead to disproportionate representation in the justice system, raising the chances of experiencing wrongful arrests, unfair trials and biased investigations. \nPolitical factors that cause miscarriages of justice include tough crime policies and political interference. Politics can highly influence the formulation of unfair policies that crack down on increasing convictions, harsh penalties and mandatory sentencing laws (Zellick 2010). The pressure to meet these standards can lead to rushed, inaccurate and wrongful convictions. Additionally, political interference and influence in the justice system can negatively impact impartial and independent justice delivery (Zellick 2010). The involvement of political agendas in convictions influences decision-making, evidence handling, and sentencing, which leaves a possibility for miscarriages of justice.\nLastly, economic influences on miscarriages of justice include the available resources and potential incentives. A judicial system that is crippled with budgetary constraints and limited resources will likely face quality issues in the delivery of investigations and prosecutions (Zellick 2010). Similarly, overcrowded courts and overburdened public defence offices will struggle to deliver justice fairy. As a result, miscarriages of justice become common. \nQuestion 2- Case Analysis\nExplain the doctrine of Judicial Precedent.\nThe case Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (1992) is centred on the issue of whether the police owed a duty of care to the individuals who were injured or died and the families of the victims during the Hillsborough Stadium disaster in 1989. In this, the House of Lords considered the claims brought to court by the families and relatives of the victims of this incident to determine whether the police had a duty of care in ensuring safety measures and controlling the crowd at Hillsborough Stadium. \nThe doctrine of Judicial Precedent is founded on the principle of stare decisis, Latin for ‘stand by things decided’ (Stone 2009).  Applying this doctrine in common law requires the judiciary to look to previous cases to determine the law (Stone 2009). In this, it is perceived that landmark cases set a precedent for subsequent determinations and are reported as law reports. \nApplying the doctrine of Judicial Precedent involves the following: when similarity exists to the prevailing conditions, the precedent may be followed. In the instance of little similarity, the cases material facts must be distinguished to set the precedent aside (Stone 2009). Therefore, judicial review, as per the doctrine of Judicial Precedent, alongside statute, formulates a binding legal authority. \nDistinguish between binding, non-binding and persuasive decisions\nBinding decisions require that a lower court abide by the decisions of a higher court. This applied to subsequent cases with similar facts (Stone 2009). For instance, in the UK, decisions from the House of Lords are binding to all lower courts. \nUnbinding decisions, on the other hand, are decisions made by courts from other jurisdictions or lower courts that are not binding but can be used as consideration in similar cases and can be persuasive (Stone 2009).\nLastly, persuasive decisions are decisions made by courts in other jurisdictions and are deemed helpful in a court determining a decision (Stone 2009). These decisions are not binding. \nDetermine the ratio decidendi and obiter dictum from Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (1992)\nRatio Decidendi is Latin for “rational for the decision.” This term refers to the chain of reasoning and the factual point that drove the determination of the final judgment in a case (Stone 2009). In the case Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (1992), the ratio decidendi determined whether the police had a duty of care to the victims and families of the Hillsborough Stadium disaster in 1989.\nObiter Dictum is the Latin word for “something said in passing” (Stone 2009). This refers to a suggestion, comment or observation made by a judge in an opinion that is not truly needed to resolve the case. Therefore, the statement, suggestion or comment is not legally binding on other courts but may be included or cited as persuasive authority in later litigation. \nQuestion 3: Mooting Exercise\nExplain the importance of a bundle in mooting exercises.\nA bundle in a mooting exercise is a folder that contains transcripts of all the materials and authorities cited in the skeleton argument (University of London 2020). It contains academic articles, statutes and cases. This bundle is given to the judge before the start of the moot. Mooters then direct the judge to specific materials during their submissions. The bundle is important in the mooting exercise in that it acts as a reference to aid in identifying relevant authorities and principles applied within a case (University of London 2020). Additionally, a bundle provides crucial information that facilitates a comprehensive and critical analysis of the legal principles in the case to ensure the best-informed decision is reached within a case (University of London 2020). Lastly, a bundle in a moot exercise offers crucial support and improves the preparedness of the judges in handling the particular case. \nAnalyse and apply relevant cases and statutory provisions to the scenario\nRelevant cases \nAlcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (1992): Applying this case to the Henry Pollard case is based on the scope of liability the construction site could potentially have. It also establishes the criteria for putting a duty of care for a traumatic event. \nMcLoughlin v OBrian (1982): This case is similar to Henry’s case as it stipulates that an individual who witnesses a traumatic event and suffers psychiatric harm as a result has the right to seek damages if the defendant has a close relationship with the plaintiff. \n\nStatutory provisions \nHealth and Safety at Work Act (1974): this statute outlines the duties of employers in protecting and ensuring the health and welfare of employees while on the clock \nOccupiers’ Liability Act (1957): the statute outlines the duty of care of occupiers of promises to ensure that all visitors are reasonably safe when on their premises. \nPresent the arguments for the parties involved in the given mooting scenario.\nPlaintiff’s Arguments\nHarry Pollard witnessed a traumatic event while working as a delivery driver for the builder’s merchant. At this time, this caused him to suffer psychiatric harm due to the horrors of witnessing the collapse and fire of the building at the construction site, causing him to witness people falling out of the building and being burnt. In this case, Harry Pollard can argue that the construction company breached its duty of care by failing to properly secure the building site, which caused the collapse and fire that he witnessed, causing him psychiatric harm. \nDefendant’s Arguments\nThe construction company can argue that Henry Pollard was not in the range of physical danger as the collapse and fire happened. Instead, he witnessed the occurrence from the site office. Additionally, the company can argue that they fulfilled their duty of care to Henry Pollard by offering him safety as a visitor to the construction site.  Similarly, like in the Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (1992) case, Pollard is claiming psychiatric harm solely based on his witnessing the traumatic event. This does not create substantial grounds for making this claim. \nEvaluate the claim and the defence based on the given scenario.\nIn this case, the main issue is for Henry Pollard to establish that the construction company owed him care of duty as a bystander to the tragic event at their construction site. To determine a fair outcome for this case, it will have to be determined how close Henry Pollard was to the construction site at the time of the incident. Additionally, it will be determined whether the construction company breached its role of care of duty. If it is determined that Henry Pollard was in the construction company’s construction site proximity and that the company breached their contract, Henry will be able to receive his damages.', 'Embark on a journey into the ARUL Live Project, an innovative venture centered around the enchanting realm of the Chocolate Masterclass Program within the Anglia Ruskin University community. This introduction serves as a portal into the essence of the project, where education, inspiration, and the exploration of the world of chocolate converge.

Communication and Management Tools To bring the ARUL Live Project plan to life, we strategically melded five foundational communication and management tools, each playing a pivotal role in propelling the project toward triumph. Grounded in core readings provided in this module, this section delves into the purpose, influence, illustrations, and contemplations on the efficacy of each tool. i.\tGantt Chart The Gantt chart, championed by Dowson et al. (2023), stood as the cornerstone for crafting the project plan. It artistically outlined tasks and their temporal contours, ushering in an organized approach to project oversight. The Gantt charts impact on actualizing the project was profound, offering the team a clear pathway to navigate. For instance, it facilitated the identification of crucial activities along the project timeline, ensuring adept management of interdependencies. In terms of communication and coordination, the Gantt chart emerged as a linchpin, fostering a shared comprehension of project milestones and deadlines among team members. Regular updates and reviews were conducted based on this visual guide, fostering transparent communication about project progress. Nevertheless, challenges surfaced in instances where unforeseen delays cropped up, demanding constant recalibration of the chart. Despite these hurdles, the Gantt chart remained indispensable for agile troubleshooting, aligning seamlessly with Dowson et al.s tenets of effective event planning. ii.\tTeam Meetings Regular team gatherings, in harmony with the principles outlined by Shone and Parry (2013), surfaced as a pivotal communication tool. These gatherings served as a forum for immediate communication, nurturing collaboration among team members. The impact of these meetings on the actualization of the project was noteworthy, ensuring that every team member stayed abreast of developments and actively engaged. Instances of effective communication during these sessions encompassed clarifications on tasks, addressing concerns, and collectively devising solutions. Coordination received a substantial boost as team members seized the opportunity to exchange updates, aligning individual endeavors with overarching project goals. Challenges were encountered in finding meeting times amenable to everyones schedules, yet the advantages of enhanced communication and coordination outweighed these logistical complexities. The reflexive nature of these team gatherings allowed for a continuous refinement process, underscoring their efficacy in cultivating a collaborative project milieu. iii.\tProject Management Software (PMS) The incorporation of a project management software (PMS), aligning with Bowdin et al.s (2006) technological counsel, instigated a transformation in communication and coordination. The PMS facilitated instantaneous collaboration, shared documentation, and task monitoring, smoothing the flow of project workflows. Its influence on actualizing the project manifested in the heightened efficiency and organization it infused into the teams operations. Instances of effective communication facilitated by the PMS encompassed centralized document storage, instant messaging capabilities, and functionalities for task assignments. Coordination reached an optimal state as team members seamlessly accessed project updates. Challenges surfaced regarding the learning curve for certain team members unfamiliar with the software, yet training sessions effectively addressed this concern. The prowess of the PMS lay in its capacity to centralize project information, offering a comprehensive perspective on progress and tasks. iv.\tRisk Assessment Matrix The adoption of a risk assessment matrix, influenced by the principles outlined by Beech et al. (2014), played a pivotal role in pinpointing and mitigating potential risks associated with the project. The impact of the risk assessment matrix manifested in its proactive stance toward risk management, curtailing the influence of uncertainties on project outcomes. Instances of effective communication materialized in routine risk review sessions, during which team members delved into identified risks and formulated strategies for mitigation. Coordination gained fortitude as the matrix became a touchstone for decision-making imbued with risk awareness. Challenges surfaced in attempting to foresee all potential risks, underscoring the dynamic nature inherent in event management. Nonetheless, the risk assessment matrix heightened the teams adeptness in navigating uncertainties, bolstering the overall resilience of the project. v.\tStakeholder Engagement Plan The crafting and execution of a stakeholder engagement plan, harmonizing with Dowson et al.s (2023) principles, played a pivotal role in nurturing positive connections with the various stakeholders entwined with the Chocolate Masterclass Program. The impact of the stakeholder engagement plan manifested in the seamless collaboration between the project team and external stakeholders. Instances of effective communication unfolded in the form of tailored messages tailored for diverse stakeholder groups, ensuring that information remained pertinent and accessible. Coordination reached an optimal state as the engagement plan took into account the varied needs and expectations of stakeholders. Challenges materialized in the delicate art of balancing conflicting stakeholder interests, demanding meticulous negotiation. Nonetheless, the stakeholder engagement plan fortified the overall success of the project by ensuring a harmonious relationship with those influenced by the Chocolate Masterclass Program. 3. Teamwork and Individual Contribution The significance of teamwork and understanding personality types stands as a cornerstone in the success of any project, as emphasized by various scholars in the field of management and organizational behavior. Effective collaboration within a team and an awareness of individual personalities contribute to a harmonious work environment, optimizing the utilization of diverse skills and enhancing overall project outcomes. Teamwork is essential as it capitalizes on collective intelligence, fostering creativity, and generating a synergy that transcends individual contributions. Dowson et al. (2023) underscore the collaborative nature of event planning and management, where diverse team members bring varied expertise to create a holistic and well-executed project. The success of the ARUL Live Project hinges on the ability of the team to function cohesively, utilizing each members strengths to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities. The theories delving into personality types wield a significant impact on unraveling how individuals approach tasks, communicate, and contribute to the collective tapestry of a team. In this realm, Belbins Team Role theory emerges as a particularly pertinent guide. In this theory, Belbin discerned nine distinct team roles, each encapsulating a unique array of behaviors and interpersonal skills within the team framework. These roles span the spectrum from the orchestrating finesse of a Coordinator to the practical efficiency of an Implementer and the dynamic assertiveness of a Shaper (Belbin, 2012). Introducing Belbins theory in the initial discourse offers a glimpse into the myriad roles individuals may inherently assume within a team, laying the foundation for a more profound exploration of team dynamics in the subsequent dialogue. Belbins theory unfurls as a valuable framework, illuminating the strengths and potential pitfalls inherent in each team member. For instance, a Completer Finisher upholds meticulous standards in task completion but may grapple with a perfectionistic streak. Conversely, a Resource Investigator excels in uncovering external opportunities but may encounter challenges in follow-through on assigned tasks (Belbin, 2012). Grasping these roles proves pivotal in optimizing team efficacy, capitalizing on each members strengths while mitigating potential weaknesses. In the context of the ARUL Live Project, the introduction of personality type theories anticipates an exploration of how these theories influenced the dynamics of the team. It sets the stage for an analysis of how awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses, based on theories like Belbins, influenced task delegation, communication strategies, and conflict resolution within the team. i.\tSelf-Evaluation of Contribution In the collaborative milieu of the ARUL Live Project, my role was multifaceted and evolving, influenced by the dynamic demands of event planning. As a member of the team, my primary contribution lay in content creation for promotional materials and coordinating communication strategies. My strengths in research and articulation were leveraged to craft compelling narratives for the event, aligning with Dowson et al.s (2023) emphasis on effective communication in event management. ii.\tInfluence of Teamwork Theories on Dynamics Teamwork theories, notably Belbins Team Role theory, played a pivotal role in shaping team dynamics. Recognizing and appreciating the diversity of team members roles according to Belbins framework fostered a climate of understanding and collaboration. For instance, acknowledging the Plant role within the team ensured creative ideation, while being mindful of the Completer Finisher role contributed to meticulous execution. This awareness influenced task allocation, enabling each team member to contribute based on their inherent strengths. iii.\tResolution of Conflicts and Challenges Despite the cohesive efforts, conflicts emerged, predominantly rooted in divergent working styles and priorities. A clash between a Shaper and a Team Worker surfaced during the planning phase. The Shaper sought quick decisions and implementation, while the Team Worker advocated for a more consensual approach. Recognizing the conflict, we initiated a facilitated discussion, drawing on insights from Moons (2004) experiential learning handbook. This process allowed team members to express concerns and preferences openly. The conflict resolution underscored the importance of open communication and compromise within diverse teams, aligning with Shone and Parrys (2013) principles of successful event management. iv.\tLessons Learned about Effective Collaboration The ARUL Live Project served as a crucible for lessons in effective collaboration. Firstly, flexibility emerged as a key factor, recognizing the evolving nature of event planning. Embracing adaptability, inspired by Shone and Parrys (2013) practical handbook, proved crucial in navigating unforeseen challenges and adjusting strategies accordingly. Secondly, communication emerged as the linchpin of collaboration. Regular team meetings, influenced by teamwork theories and reflective of Dowson et al.s (2023) communication principles, facilitated a shared understanding of project progress. Clear communication channels mitigated misunderstandings and ensured everyone remained on the same page. Thirdly, conflict, when addressed constructively, became a catalyst for innovation. The clash of perspectives highlighted the richness of diverse viewpoints, ultimately contributing to a more robust event plan. Lessons from Moons (2004) handbook on experiential learning guided our approach to conflict resolution, emphasizing a reflective and inclusive process. 3. Project Performance and Outcomes The success of the ARUL Live Project, centered on the Chocolate Masterclass Program, is integral to its overall performance and outcomes. As the curtains draw on this dynamic venture, it becomes imperative to dissect the intricacies of its execution, evaluating not only triumphs but also challenges encountered along the way. The ARUL Live Project aimed to educate, inspire, and explore the world of chocolate through a meticulously planned Chocolate Masterclass Program. Commencing with the purpose of the event, which included learning new techniques, creating chocolate truffles, and exploring the nuances of the chocolate-making process, the projects success is intrinsically tied to its ability to fulfill these objectives. The events SMART objectives, ranging from identifying necessary resources to designing promotional materials, served as benchmarks for performance evaluation, as recommended by Dowson et al. (2023). The emphasis on assessing challenges is paramount in understanding the projects outcomes comprehensively. The intricacies of event planning, as highlighted by Shone and Parry (2013), often entail unexpected hurdles. Two specific challenges faced during the project will be explored in detail, shedding light on how these obstacles were navigated. This reflective analysis aligns with the broader philosophy of Moons (2004) experiential learning handbook, emphasizing the transformative potential embedded in challenges. Learning from challenges is a linchpin for continuous improvement. Whether contending with logistical complexities, unforeseen time constraints, or competing schedules, each challenge provides a platform for growth and refinement. By addressing challenges head-on, the ARUL Live Project not only enriched its outcomes but also laid the groundwork for enhanced project management in the future. The ensuing discussion will delve into the specific challenges encountered and the strategies employed to overcome them, encapsulating the essence of reflective practice in the context of event management. i.\tChallenges Faced The ARUL Live Project, despite its overall success, encountered two distinct challenges that posed significant hurdles during the implementation of the Chocolate Masterclass Program. The first challenge pertained to the limited coverage of the masterclass, as it became apparent that certain key areas were not sufficiently addressed within the predetermined timeframe. This challenge impacted the project by potentially limiting its appeal to a broader audience. The concise duration of the class, lasting less than an hour, contributed to this limitation, hindering the depth of coverage for participants interested in foundational knowledge for chocolate making. The impact manifested in a potential gap in the comprehensive learning experience intended for the chocolate enthusiasts, necessitating a strategic reevaluation of the class structure for future iterations. The second challenge stemmed from the constrained reach of potential customers due to the on-campus location of the masterclass. Despite the proximity to the target audience, the physical confines of the campus created a barrier for enthusiasts who were not located within its immediate vicinity. This challenge had a direct impact on attendance and participation, limiting the pool of potential attendees and curbing the events reach beyond the university community. Addressing this challenge required a rethinking of the events logistical setup and a consideration of alternative locations or supplementary digital engagement strategies. The complicated nature of scheduling created another challenge, especially concerning the availability of the specialized chocolate chef from ROSL and the Director of Food and Beverage. Coordinating their attendance with the events timeline posed difficulties due to their busy schedules. This challenge influenced the overall planning and flow of the masterclass, potentially impacting the seamless execution of certain elements. The scheduling constraints underscored the need for enhanced coordination and a more flexible approach to accommodate the time constraints of external contributors. Another challenge arose from unexpected technical glitches during the event. The integration of technology, such as audiovisual equipment for presentations and demonstrations, faced intermittent issues that momentarily disrupted the flow of the masterclass. These technical challenges created a temporary disconnect between the presenters and the audience, affecting the overall engagement and learning experience. Addressing these glitches in real-time required on-the-spot problem-solving and adaptability, emphasizing the importance of thorough technical rehearsals and contingency plans for future events ii.\tOvercoming Challenges and Enhancing Future Projects During the event, we welcomed invaluable support from the Director of Food and Beverage and the specialized chocolate chef from ROSL. Their presence not only added expertise but also shed light on the daily operations of their company, providing valuable insights for our guests. Their openness and willingness to share their experiences enriched the event, offering our attendees a broader perspective on the chocolate-making industry. Personally, interacting with them during the event was an enlightening experience, and their contributions significantly contributed to overcoming the challenges we faced. Their guidance and insights served as a catalyst for refining our approach and enhancing the overall impact of the Chocolate Masterclass Program. In tackling the hurdles faced during the ARUL Live Project, we implemented strategic interventions to alleviate constraints and elevate the overall efficacy of the Chocolate Masterclass Program. Confronting the challenge of limited coverage, the team orchestrated a nuanced response by integrating supplementary resources. This involved the crafting of online materials, including instructional videos and digital resources, to complement the concise in-person sessions. This adaptive maneuver sought to furnish participants with a more expansive learning encounter, transcending the temporal confinements of the class duration. The success of this approach resonated in the positive feedback garnered from participants who delved into the online materials, signifying success over the initial limitation. In surmounting the challenge posed by the on-campus locations limited reach, the team adopted a dual-fold strategy. Initially, we delved into the viability of off-campus venues for prospective masterclasses, aiming to broaden accessibility to a more extensive audience. Simultaneously, we ventured into the realm of technology, exploring the integration of video-conferencing tools to enable virtual participation for those unable to be physically present. The success of these strategies found affirmation in heightened interest and participation observed in subsequent masterclasses held off-campus. Additionally, the positive response to virtual engagement options underscored the effectiveness of these measures. Reflecting on the effectiveness of these strategies, it is evident that the adaptive measures successfully addressed the identified challenges, enriching the projects outcomes. Lessons learned from this experience pave the way for improvements in future projects. In particular, future initiatives can benefit from an inherent flexibility in design, allowing for seamless integration of online components to enhance accessibility. Additionally, exploring diverse locations and embracing technology as a core component of event planning strategies will be integral to reaching a broader audience. This adaptive and forward-thinking approach aligns with the evolving landscape of event management, ensuring that future projects are not only resilient to challenges but also well-positioned to exceed initial expectations. The iterative nature of these strategies exemplifies the commitment to continuous improvement and responsiveness to the dynamic nature of event planning. 4.

Reflective practice, therefore, emerges as a guiding principle, steering the trajectory of projects towards resilience, innovation, and enduring success.', 'Role of Molecular Biology in Evolutionary Classification The advent of DNA technology has revolutionized the field of biology, particularly in the domain of evolutionary classification. Traditional classification schemes relied heavily on morphological traits, such as physical appearance and structure, to group organisms into taxonomic categories. However, these methods often led to inaccuracies due to convergent evolution or phenotypic plasticity. Molecular biology, through the analysis of DNA and protein sequences, provides a more precise tool for understanding evolutionary relationships. This essay explores how recent advancements in DNA technology enhance the accuracy of classification schemes, reveal relatedness among organisms, and offer insights into the duration of evolutionary divergence, while also considering their implications for the future of evolutionary biology. DNA technology, particularly DNA sequencing, has become a cornerstone in establishing evolutionary relationships. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of specific genes or entire genomes, scientists can identify similarities and differences that reflect genetic relatedness. For instance, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow researchers to amplify and analyze DNA from diverse organisms efficiently (Metzker, 2010). These technologies have revealed that organisms with similar morphologies may not share a recent common ancestor, while others with divergent appearances may be closely related. A notable example is the reclassification of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) as close relatives of artiodactyls (e.g., hippos) based on molecular data, overturning earlier morphology-based hypotheses (Nikaido et al., 1999). This precision underscores how DNA evidence provides a more objective basis for phylogenetic trees, which depict evolutionary relationships. Beyond establishing relatedness, molecular biology offers insights into the temporal aspects of evolution. The molecular clock hypothesis posits that mutations accumulate in DNA at a relatively constant rate over time, allowing scientists to estimate when two species diverged from a common ancestor. By calibrating these rates with fossil records, researchers can calculate divergence times with greater accuracy. For example, studies of mitochondrial DNA have helped estimate the divergence of humans and chimpanzees at approximately 6-8 million years ago (Kumar et al., 2017). This temporal dimension enhances classification by providing a dynamic view of evolution, linking genetic data to historical events and refining taxonomic groupings. The future of evolutionary classification is poised to be profoundly shaped by molecular biology. As DNA sequencing becomes cheaper and more accessible, comprehensive genomic databases will enable large-scale comparisons across species. Techniques like CRISPR-based gene editing and single-cell sequencing may further refine our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms, such as gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer, which traditional taxonomy overlooked. Moreover, integrating molecular data with bioinformatics tools will facilitate the construction of robust phylogenies, potentially leading to a redefinition of taxonomic boundaries (Metzker, 2010). However, challenges remain, such as interpreting complex genomic data and reconciling molecular findings with existing classifications. In conclusion, DNA technology has transformed evolutionary classification by providing a reliable, quantifiable means to assess relatedness and divergence times.', 'Subject: Computer Sciences and Information Technology 1. \uf0b2 Ambiguity in Requirements Reason: One of the most challenging aspects of identifying IT acquisition requirements is translating business needs into clear, specific, and actionable IT requirements. Stakeholders often express their needs in vague terms, or they may not fully understand the technical possibilities and limitations of IT systems. This ambiguity leads to incomplete or misunderstood requirements, causing delays, cost overruns, or the delivery of a system that doesnt meet the organizations needs. Solution: To address this issue, organizations can employ structured requirements-gathering techniques, such as interviews, workshops, and user story creation, combined with clear documentation methods like requirement traceability matrices (RTMs). Involving a diverse group of stakeholders, including end-users, IT specialists, and decision-makers, ensures that all perspectives are considered and properly documented. 2. \uf075 Before Contract Signing ·  Permissibility: It should be permitted to adjust requirements up to the point a contract is signed, but with strict oversight and approval processes. ·  Reason: Before the contract is finalized, changes in business priorities, technological advancements, or stakeholder feedback may necessitate modifications to requirements. This flexibility ensures the project scope aligns with the current organizational needs. ·  Control Mechanism: To prevent unnecessary delays or confusion, any changes should go through a structured change management process, ensuring they are well-documented, justified, and communicated to all parties involved. \uf075 After Contract Signing (During the Project) • Permissibility: It should be possible to modify requirements during the project lifecycle, but under tightly controlled conditions. • Reason: Projects often encounter unforeseen circumstances, such as new regulatory requirements, changing business goals, or the discovery of better solutions. Allowing limited flexibility can enhance project success by ensuring relevance and value. • Control Mechanism: A formal change control process must be established to evaluate and approve changes based on their impact on scope, timeline, and cost. 3. The process of creating the WBS provided a structured approach to planning and executing the project. It enhanced clarity, improved time management, and facilitated better communication among the stakeholders. What Was Easy? Identifying the main deliverables and breaking the project into major components was straightforward. By starting with the overall goal and gradually dividing it into logical sections, I found it easier to visualize the scope of the project. Tools like brainstorming sessions and project templates provided a clear framework for organizing tasks. What Was Difficult? The challenging part was determining the appropriate level of detail for each task. Striking a balance between high-level categories and overly granular tasks was tricky because I wanted the WBS to be both comprehensive and practical. Additionally, ensuring that all dependencies and interconnections between tasks were accounted for required careful thought and iterative reviews. Problems Encountered and Solutions Ambiguity in Task Definition: Initially, some tasks were too vague, making it hard to assign responsibilities or estimate timeframes. Solution: I refined each task by asking specific questions like "What does this task aim to achieve?" and "What resources are required?" This helped me clarify objectives and outcomes. Overlapping Tasks: Certain tasks overlapped, leading to potential duplication of effort. Solution: I consolidated overlapping tasks and aligned them with the broader objectives to avoid redundancy. Unaccounted Dependencies: Some dependencies were initially overlooked, which could have caused delays during execution. Solution: I reviewed the WBS with a focus on task interdependencies and used a Gantt chart to map them visually, ensuring a logical flow.', 'Background Pressure injuries are known to pose considerable challenges in healthcare settings, impacting patient outcomes and contributing significantly to overall healthcare costs. Nevertheless, although we have traditional intervention approaches and their benefits, they still present limitations in effectively preventing pressure injuries. As a result, this calls for an exploration of innovative solutions that can leverage smart technologies to enhance preventive measures. Significance The profound impact of pressure injuries on patient health, quality of life, and healthcare costs underscores an urgent need for effective preventive measures. In this regard, the research question, In hospitalized patients at risk for PI, does the use of smart devices decrease the incidence of pressure injury compared to current stage IV circulation air mattresses, guided by the PICO framework, seeks to look into the effectiveness of smart devices in reducing the incidence of pressure injuries in hospitalized patients at risk when compared to the conventional stage IV circulation air mattresses. Methods Our exploration into the smart technology for pressure injury prevention encompasses diverse methodologies, whereby the Leaf Health (2017) article employs the Leaf System, a groundbreaking approach that actively monitors patient turns to demonstrate promising results. Similarly, Memari et al. (2021) contribute to the discourse by designing a smart mattress that focuses on monitoring bedsore ulcer prevention, while Moore et al. (2023) conduct a systemic review that evaluates various movement monitoring devices for their predictive capabilities regarding ulcers in at-risk adults. In other words, these diverse methodologies offer a comprehensive perspective on innovative pressure injury prevention, thus serving as motivation for innovators and the urge to enhance patient outcomes. Synthesis & Findings The synthesis of findings from these studies highlights the potential of smart technologies in revolutionizing pressure injury prevention. For instance, as demonstrated in Leaf Healthcares smart technology, with a key emphasis on active patient turn monitoring, the results displayed a significant reduction in pressure injury rates. Subsequently, the Memarie et al. (2021) study provides an additional layer of innovation in bedsore ulcer prevention, while Moore et al. (2023) and Minteer et al., (2020) contribute to a broader understanding of movement monitoring devices to emphasize their role in predicting pressure ulcers. Collectively, these practical findings advocate for the integration of smart devices in our approach to pressure injury prevention. Practice Recommendation The various studies, and in particular, the Leaf Health study, demonstrate positive outcomes to advocate for a paradigm shift in our approach to pressure injury prevention. Therefore, we recommend the incorporation of smart devices such as the Leaf Systems into the routine care protocols in hospital settings as this strategic move aligns with the evolving landscape of healthcare technologies and emphasizes the need for proactive measures in patient care (Leaf Health, 2017). Strategy & Implementation While it is clear that there are substantial benefits of smart technology application in healthcare, getting to implement them into the practices presents several challenges. For instance, two of the significant barriers include cost and staff education, which apparently cannot be overlooked. To overcome the cost barrier, we recommend securing funding grants, seeking partnerships with different industry stakeholders, and allocating the internal budget as some of the essential strategies (Leaf Health (2017; Silva et al., 2021). In addition, health facilities need to invest in comprehensive staff education programs that would ensure that their professionals are well-versed in the benefits and how to optimally employ the different smart devices. Evaluation and Outcome The primary objective is to enhance patient outcomes; thus, anticipating positive outcomes is essential in the implementation of smart technology. Basically, by reducing pressure injuries and the associated costs, we are certain that these devices have the potential to revolutionize patient care; hence, continuous evaluation of outcomes will provide valuable insights into their effectiveness while at the same time supporting their integration into standard care practices (Avsar et al., 2020). Implication of Nursing Practice Smart devices and advanced technology have far-reaching implications for nursing practices, and therefore, by automating and optimizing patient turn protocols, healthcare professionals are empowered to deliver better care while mitigating the workload associated with pressure injury prevention. Next Steps Getting to secure funding grants, initiating training programs, and establishing partnerships with various stakeholders marks a crucial step in the advancement and implementation of smart devices in pressure injury prevention. Generally, having a collaborative and multifaceted approach is essential to ensuring the successful integration of these technologies into routine healthcare practices. Barriers to Implementation Cost The financial implications cannot be understated. However, different approaches, such as seeking grants, having internal budget allocations, and exploring partnerships, can provide viable solutions to overcome cost-related barriers. Education for Staff The success of this initiative lies in the understanding and acceptance of smart technologies by healthcare professionals. Therefore, introducing educational programs will ensure that they are well-equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to maximize the benefits of these gadgets (Minteer et al., 2020). Funding Grants Funding grants are an essential component in supporting the acquisition and integration of smart devices, as financial support is critical for the sustained implementation of innovative technologies. How Will We Support the Cost Financially? In order to support the financial costs that are associated with this initiative, a number of recommendations are made, which include seeking grants, establishing collaboration with interested parties, and setting a budget for the program. Partnership with Other Organizations Collaborating with other organizations is pivotal in fostering the successful integration of this program. As a result, by forming strategic partnerships, getting to share resources, and leveraging collective expertise, healthcare facilities are going to have the upper hand in navi1gating challenges and collectively contributing to advancing patient care through innovative technologies.', 'Database tools assist data owners, custodians, incident responders to manage, secure, and analyze information. Depending on the user type, the tools available vary in their functionality. The present analysis explores various databases tools available to users, categorizing them according to the type of user. Data Owners Data owners have three kinds of database tools to help with governance, classification, and monitoring. Data governance tools enable the definition and enforcement of data policies to ensure regulatory compliance and manage access permissions (Soares, 2015). Conversely, data classification tools function by categorizing information according to its sensitivity to help implement access controls and other security measures (Blokdyk, 2018). Finally, the functionalities of data monitoring tools are associated with data access, usage, and modifications to guarantee information is used correctly and according to existing policies. Custodians Data custodians use database tools for three primary functions: management, encryption, and backup and recovery. Database management systems (DBMS) are the first category of tools that custodians use, and the functionalities include data storage, retrieval, and security (Gill, 2023). Besides, custodians rely on data encryption tools to secure sensitive information at rest and in transit through encryption, maintaining the confidentiality of information. Database backup and recovery are essential for storing copies of data to secure it against the risk of corruption and accidental or malicious deletion. Incident Responders Incident responders use database tools such as security tools, activity monitoring, and intrusion detection and prevention (IDP) for various purposes. Database security tools provide functionalities such as monitoring and identifying security threats, while IDP tools offer the capacity to identify and prevent unauthorized access (Nayak & Rao, 2014). Database activity monitoring provide real-time monitoring as a functionality to help responders detect and respond to malicious or suspicious activities. Investigators The final category of database users are investigators who depend on forensic, auditing, and query and reporting tools. The functionalities of forensic tools enable the gathering of evidence of threat incidents or data breaches (Blodyk, 2018). Auditing tools functionalities comprise the review of database logs to trace user activity and determine instances of unauthorized access or anomalies (Bush, 2022). Query and reporting tools offer functionalities such as complex querying and report generation to assess usage patterns and trends, which inform whether security threats or incidents occurred.', 'Abstract\nThis research investigates the nature and impact of pilot distractions in private aviation, focusing on identifying effective mitigation measures.

He noted, "Passengers sometimes engage with the cockpit directly. These conversations range from casual to specific catering requests."\nImpact of Distractions: While most interactions were manageable, Adryan acknowledged that distractions during critical flight phases, such as descent and landing, could be particularly problematic. He estimated that distractions occur in about 10-15% of flights, emphasizing the need for effective communication and boundary-setting with passengers.\nMitigation Strategies: Adryan emphasized the importance of setting clear boundaries and informing passengers about critical flight phases to mitigate distractions. He mentioned, "I often tell them they should not talk to us when the seatbelts must be on, mainly during takeoffs and landings."\nDifferences Between Charter Clients and Owners: Adryan observed that charter clients are more likely to cause distractions compared to aircraft owners. He explained, "Owners often understand the protocol well and are aware of the boundaries for flight safety."\nFormal Training: While Adryan did not receive specific training on managing passenger distractions, he noted that cockpit resource management (CRM) training covered aspects of communication, teamwork, and decision-making, which indirectly helped manage distractions.\nSterile Cockpit Protocol: Adryan supported the sterile cockpit protocol but acknowledged the challenges of maintaining it in private jet operations due to the lack of a physical barrier between the cockpit and passengers. He stated, "Maintaining the sterile cockpit works well, but it can be more challenging in our sector."\nDiscussion\nOverview\nThis section interprets the findings presented in the results section, providing a detailed analysis of the trends, patterns, and implications. It compares the results with existing literature, addresses the limitations of the study, and offers recommendations for future research and practical applications.\nInterpretation of Findings\nThe findings from this study provide a comprehensive insight into the nature and impact of pilot distractions in private aviation. The survey results highlight that the majority of pilots, particularly captains, report experiencing distractions from various sources, with passengers being the most frequent cause. This aligns with existing literature, which suggests that pilot distractions are a significant concern in aviation safety (Harris, 2011; Dismukes, Young & Sumwalt, 2016).\nDemographics and Experience\nThe demographic data indicates that most respondents are experienced pilots, with the majority having over ten years of experience and significant flight hours. This demographic distribution is beneficial as it provides insights from seasoned professionals who are likely to have encountered and managed various in-flight distractions. The predominance of captains in the sample further adds weight to the findings, as their role involves greater responsibility for flight safety. Notably, pilots aged between 30 and 49 years constitute the majority, reflecting a mature cohort with substantial industry exposure.\nThe extensive experience reported by the pilots enhances the reliability of the survey responses, given their familiarity with both routine operations and emergency procedures. The distribution of flight hours further supports this, with a significant proportion of respondents logging over 3000 hours. This depth of experience is critical in understanding the nuanced impacts of distractions, as more experienced pilots are likely to have developed personal coping mechanisms and insights into effective mitigation strategies.\nSources and Frequency of Distractions\nThe data reveals that passengers are the primary source of distractions, followed by colleague pilots and flight attendants. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have identified passenger interactions as a major source of in-flight distractions (Jones, 2013; Smith & Jones, 2018). Passengers asking questions during critical phases of flight, engaging in conversations, and entering the cockpit uninvited were frequently cited. These behaviors disrupt the sterile cockpit environment, which is crucial during takeoff and landing phases when pilots\' focus is paramount.\nColleague pilots and flight attendants also contribute to distractions, though to a lesser extent. Interactions with colleagues are often necessary for operational reasons but can become disruptive if not managed properly. The use of mobile devices and external factors such as weather or air traffic control communications were additional sources of distraction. The frequency of these distractions varies, with a significant portion of pilots experiencing them sometimes or about half the time. This variability underscores the need for effective management strategies to mitigate these distractions.\nImpact on Flight Safety\nThe impact of distractions on flight safety is a critical finding. Pilots rated the impact on a scale of 0 to 10, with the mean rating indicating a moderate to significant impact. Notably, the descent and landing phases are identified as the most problematic for distractions. This is a crucial insight, as these flight phases require heightened attention and precision. The finding that some pilots have encountered near-miss incidents due to distractions further underscores the potential risks associated with in-flight interruptions.\nPilots must manage complex procedures during descent and landing, communicate with air traffic control, and make critical decisions. Distractions during these phases can lead to errors, as evidenced by near-miss incidents reported by some respondents. This finding aligns with broader aviation safety literature, which identifies the final phases of flight as particularly vulnerable to disruptions (Dismukes, Young & Sumwalt, 2016). The moderate to high impact ratings assigned to distractions highlight the pressing need for enhanced protocols and training to mitigate these risks.\nMitigation Measures\nThe survey results highlight several current mitigation measures, such as the presence of flight attendants and formal training on managing distractions. However, the effectiveness of these measures is perceived as moderate, suggesting room for improvement. Most pilots believe that additional training would be beneficial, and many emphasize the importance of clear communication and passenger briefings.\nHaving a flight attendant onboard is seen as a positive measure, as they can manage passenger interactions and reduce the frequency of distractions entering the cockpit. However, the perceived effectiveness of current training programs on managing distractions is mixed, with many pilots suggesting that these programs need to be more comprehensive and practical. Passenger briefings are emphasized, with pilots recommending regular reminders about the sterile cockpit rules and the critical phases of flight when silence is essential.\nComparison with Existing Literature\nThe study\'s findings are in line with existing research on pilot distractions. Previous studies have documented the prevalence and impact of distractions in aviation, emphasizing the need for robust management strategies (Harris, 2011; Dismukes, Young & Sumwalt, 2016). The identification of passengers as a major source of distraction is particularly noteworthy, as it echoes findings from studies on commercial aviation (Jones, 2013; Smith & Jones, 2018). The significance of the descent and landing phases as critical periods for distractions aligns with the broader understanding of aviation safety, which highlights these phases as requiring utmost concentration.\nExisting literature also supports the notion that effective communication and training are vital in managing distractions. For instance, Harris (2011) underscores the importance of communication protocols and structured briefings to mitigate in-flight interruptions. The findings of this study corroborate this view, with pilots emphasizing the need for clear and regular communication with passengers. Additionally, Dismukes, Young, and Sumwalt (2016) highlight the role of training in enhancing pilots\' ability to manage distractions, a sentiment echoed by the respondents in this study.\nInterview Insights\nThe interview with Adryan, a seasoned captain with over 25 years of experience, provided valuable qualitative insights that complement the survey findings. Adryan highlighted the unique challenges of managing distractions in private jet operations, where the absence of a physical barrier between the cockpit and passengers can lead to frequent interactions. While most interactions are manageable, he noted that distractions during critical flight phases such as descent and landing can be particularly problematic. Adryan estimated that distractions occur in about 10-15% of flights, emphasizing the need for clear communication and boundary-setting with passengers.\nAdryan\'s experiences underscore the importance of proactive measures to mitigate distractions, such as setting clear boundaries and informing passengers about the critical phases of the flight. His observations regarding the differences between charter clients and aircraft owners in terms of causing distractions align with the survey findings, highlighting the need for tailored communication strategies. Furthermore, Adryan\'s support for the sterile cockpit protocol and the challenges of maintaining it in private jet operations reflect broader concerns in the industry, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement and proactive passenger management.\nSurprising Findings in the Survey\nUpon analyzing the survey data, several findings stand out as unexpected or surprising. These insights provide deeper understanding and highlight areas that may require further attention or reconsideration of current practices.\n1. High Impact of Non-Passenger Related Distractions\nWhile passenger-related distractions were anticipated to be a primary concern, the survey revealed that distractions from colleague pilots and external factors (such as mobile devices and external environments) were also significant. This finding suggests that even within the controlled environment of the cockpit, various elements can divert attention from flight operations.\nMobile Devices: The frequency of distractions from mobile devices was notable. Despite strict regulations and protocols intended to minimize their use during critical phases, pilots reported significant interruptions from these devices.\nExternal Environment: Factors outside the aircraft, such as weather conditions, air traffic communications, and visual stimuli, also emerged as notable distractions. This highlights the complexity of the pilot\'s operational environment, where multiple sources of information must be processed simultaneously.\n2. Variability in Comfort Levels with Addressing Passengers\nThe comfort levels of pilots in addressing passenger behavior varied widely, with some pilots feeling extremely comfortable and others significantly uncomfortable. This variability was surprising, given the critical importance of managing passenger behavior to ensure flight safety.\nComfort Levels: The data indicated that some pilots, particularly less experienced ones, felt uncomfortable addressing passengers directly about their behavior. This discomfort could stem from a lack of confidence, fear of confrontation, or insufficient training in communication skills.\nImplications for Training: The wide range of comfort levels suggests that current training programs may not be adequately preparing all pilots to manage passenger interactions effectively. Tailored training that includes role-playing and communication strategies could help address this gap.\n3. Effectiveness of Current Training on Managing Distractions\nAnother surprising finding was the mixed perception of the effectiveness of current training programs on managing distractions. While some pilots found the training to be extremely effective, others rated it as only moderately or slightly effective.\nTraining Perception: The disparity in perceived effectiveness indicates that there may be inconsistencies in how distraction management training is delivered or received. Pilots’ individual experiences and the specific content of the training programs they attended could account for these differences.\nNeed for Standardization: This finding underscores the need for standardized, high-quality training programs that ensure all pilots receive comprehensive and practical instruction on managing distractions.\n4. Importance of Flight Attendants\nThe role of flight attendants in reducing passenger-related distractions was highlighted as highly effective by many pilots. This finding was somewhat unexpected, given that the primary focus of flight attendants is often seen as passenger service and safety rather than direct support to the cockpit crew.\nFlight Attendant Impact: Pilots who frequently flew with flight attendants reported fewer passenger-related distractions, indicating that flight attendants play a crucial role in managing passenger behavior and maintaining a sterile cockpit environment.\nTraining for Flight Attendants: This emphasizes the importance of including flight attendants in distraction management training, ensuring they are equipped to support pilots effectively.\n5. Passenger-Related Near-Miss Incidents\nThe occurrence of passenger-related near-miss incidents reported by some pilots was an alarming finding. This highlights the severe potential consequences of in-flight distractions and the critical need for robust mitigation measures.\nNear-Miss Incidents: The fact that distractions have led to near-miss situations underscores the real and present danger these distractions pose to flight safety. These incidents serve as a stark reminder of the importance of minimizing distractions.\nReporting and Mitigation: The survey results suggest that there may be underreporting of such incidents due to fear of repercussions or a lack of awareness about the importance of reporting. Encouraging a culture of transparency and non-punitive reporting can help in identifying and addressing distraction-related risks.\n6. Differing Views on the Sterile Cockpit Rule\nThere were differing views on the effectiveness and implementation of the sterile cockpit rule, which prohibits non-essential activities and communications during critical phases of flight. Some pilots felt that the current protocols were adequate and effective, while others believed that more stringent enforcement and additional measures were necessary.\nProtocol Effectiveness: The mixed feedback on sterile cockpit protocols suggests that while the rule is well-intentioned, its implementation may vary across different airlines and flight operations. Some pilots may not fully adhere to the protocols, potentially due to a lack of awareness or differing interpretations of the rule.\nEnhanced Measures: Pilots suggested additional measures such as better passenger briefings and physical barriers (e.g., cockpit curtains) to enhance the effectiveness of the sterile cockpit rule.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is embracing measures to improve its audit control practices, intending to develop world-class HRM practices (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 3). This article explores the pivotal elements shaping the efficiency of internal audits, drawing parallels between China and the GCC countries. The analysis focuses on the challenges associated with preserving transparency and scrutinizes the elements that affect audit control efficiency within the public sector of GCC countries. Through a critical analysis, there is an understanding of the efforts by these GCC states to achieve excellence in human resource management and governance methods, promoting an environment where transparency and accountability are paramount.\nInternal Audit Effectiveness\nIn the public sector of GCC countries, numerous difficulties and prospects shape the critical elements that affect the effectiveness of audit control in HRM. Internal auditors in the GCC grapple with challenges that include a rapid rate of employee turnover and a deficiency in technical abilities and specialized knowledge concerning certain areas of auditing. Yeboah sampled the studies that focused on public sector organizations in Ethiopia and government-owned enterprises in Ghana, underscoring an empirical necessity to investigate what drives effectiveness in internal audits (1977).\nThe perspectives of internal auditors in the GCC public sector are pivotal for deciphering the critical elements that impact the effectiveness of internal audits. Alzeban and Gwilliam's study on Saudi Arabia scrutinized these influential dynamics, shedding light on the challenges internal auditors in the region face (74). This study incorporated 239 internal auditors from a total of 79 public sector organizations across Saudi Arabia. The findings stress the significance of factors like organizational culture, managerial support, and the proficiency of internal auditors as determinants of audit effectiveness. These results are corroborated by research conducted by Liston‐Heyes and Juillet (659). Additionally, Scott-Jackson et al. highlight arguments from business leaders that top-notch HRIM solutions could boost profits for businesses in the GCC by at least 12%, which translates to $14 billion added to their reported profits (10).\nConcrete measures must be taken within the public sector of the GCC to tackle issues related to high employee turnover rates and a deficit in technical abilities and specialized knowledge within certain audit areas. Organizations should focus on talent retention strategies, including professional development opportunities, competitive compensation, and a supportive work environment to mitigate the impact of high staff turnover (Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)). Additionally, implementing training and development initiatives customized to the necessary technical abilities and knowledge for particular audit fields can bolster the proficiency of internal auditors. This step will strengthen the overall effectiveness of internal audits within the GCC's public sector.\n\n\nComparative Study of Internal Audit System\nHazaea et al. conducted a study comparing China's internal audit system against that of the GCC countries (Hazaea, Zhu, et al. 1). Research results indicate a marked difference in the internal auditing mechanisms within these distinct areas and their respective influences on HRM. The auditing structures in both contexts are in constant development, with a strong emphasis on adhering to international standards, alongside having inherent strengths and facing particular challenges.\nResearch findings indicate a considerable difference in the development of internal audit mechanisms between China and countries within the GCC. Research suggests that China boasts a more developed internal auditing infrastructure due to its strong regulatory framework and consistent adherence to international standards (Hazaea, Zhu, et al. 4). Conversely, the GCC's audit control frameworks are comparatively less developed and exhibit inconsistent application of international standards. A further point of divergence lies in the perception of internal audits regarding human resources management. Chinese organizations consider internal audits essential for enhancing and safeguarding business integrity, whereas their counterparts in GCC nations view them as tools for ensuring compliance (Hazaea, Zhu, et al. 4).\nThe varying viewpoints can influence how internal auditors function within Human Resource Management and their capacity to assist with the organization's strategic goals. Furthermore, the research accentuates that internal auditors in these two contexts grapple with issues like insufficient technical abilities and expertise in certain areas of auditing (Hazaea, Zhu, et al. 4). The research proposes increased investment in training and development initiatives to equip personnel with essential technical skills for particular audit areas as among the ways to overcome these challenges. Moreover, Hazaea, Zhu, et al. recommend incorporating best practices from different nations into GCC countries' audit frameworks to improve the effectiveness of their internal audit operations. (4-5)\nBurdens of Transparency\nTransparent internal auditing practices within the public sector are crucial for maintaining accountability and sound governance. Nonetheless, the obligation to disclose information publicly can burden GCC public sector internal auditors significantly, potentially hindering their performance. Those internal auditors in the GCC who view these disclosure mandates as obstacles are often confronted with difficulties when attempting to execute their responsibilities effectively (Liston-Heyes & Juillet, 2020).\nThe GCC's public entities are navigating a challenging landscape of transparency and mandatory disclosure protocols. Ensuring transparency is essential for upholding accountable governance; however, the strict obligations to disclose information publicly can pressure internal auditors considerably. Such pressure arises as auditors strive to comply with strict regulatory requirements while attempting to fulfill their primary auditing responsibilities effectively. Concerns about being subjected to public scrutiny and facing consequent repercussions might influence the impartiality and independence of these auditors (Tawfik et al. e12389). Furthermore, when internal auditors in the GCC's public sector are preoccupied with adhering to complex public disclosure requirements, it may detract from their core tasks, thus impeding their contribution to improving governance frameworks and risk management capabilities within their organizations.\nAddressing transparency-related burdens in the public sector requires organizations within the public sector of the GCC to offer sufficient support and allocate resources for internal auditors, focusing on empowering them through advanced training and development opportunities. Such initiatives should be tailored to improve their competencies in dealing with public transparency demands and preserving their capability to execute audit activities proficiently (Yeboah 1980). Moreover, creating an environment that values transparency and fosters straightforward communication can assist in reducing the burdens that internal auditors face. This change facilitates a more efficient accomplishment of their auditing responsibilities for increased effectiveness.\nFactors Affecting Internal Audit Effectiveness\nExtensive research has been dedicated to determining what shapes the effectiveness of internal audit in the public sector in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Within this context, a study in Saudi Arabia examined critical elements that impact the effectiveness of internal auditing procedures within public organizations and shed light on the challenges and prospects internal auditors in the GCC face (Alzeban and Gwilliam 74). The investigative results pointed to numerous influential factors regarding internal audit effectiveness in the GCC. Notably, a strong organizational culture was highlighted as crucial; evidence points to how a supportive ethical culture within an organization can enhance the effectiveness of internal audit operations. The results further showed that management support is important in this respect as it helps reinforce auditor independence and ensure their work is properly executed (Alzeban and Gwilliam 74).\nAdditionally, Alzeban and Gwilliam examine how competence and technical abilities influence the effectiveness of internal audits (74). The study emphasizes that enhancing audit control effectiveness requires investment in the internal auditors' professional development to improve their technical expertise and competencies (Alzeban and Gwilliam 75). Such professional development and expertise are important for internal auditors to navigate complex audit areas and address emerging risks effectively. Furthermore, communication and collaboration within organizations can promote open communication channels and collaboration between internal auditors and other stakeholders, promoting effective audit processes (Alzeban and Gwilliam 74). The insights from the survey conducted in Saudi Arabia provide valuable guidance for enhancing internal audit effectiveness in the GCC public sector. \nConclusion\nCritical factors influencing audit control systems effectiveness and an analysis comparing the internal audit frameworks across different contexts demonstrate the complexities, challenges, and potential of the internal control in the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) public sector. The comparison of China's and the GCC's audit control frameworks depicts stark contrasts in development levels, compliance with international standards, practice, and the role of audit control within HRM. Furthermore, obligations tied to transparency, especially those concerning mandatory public reporting, have been shown to affect how efficiently internal auditors can manage governance concerns and oversee risk management aspects. Furthermore, a survey conducted in Saudi Arabia identified critical factors influencing internal audit effectiveness, emphasizing the significance of organizational culture, management support, competence and technical skills, and communication and collaboration within organizations. Addressing these factors and challenges is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of internal audit functions in the GCC public sector, contributing to improved governance and risk management practices in the region.", ' Based on the above results, there are some notable differences between the original dataset and the updated dataset:\nNormality Test: \nFor the original dataset, the Shapiro-Wilk test fails to reject the null hypothesis of normality for the "D_FINANCE_UPTAKE" variable (p-value = 0.18904).\nFor the updated dataset, the Shapiro-Wilk test fails to reject the null hypothesis of normality for the "ln_Digital_Finance_Uptake" variable (p-value = 0.69137).\nThis suggests that the dependent variable in both datasets can be considered normally distributed, which is a desirable condition for regression analysis.\nRegression Analysis: \nIn the original dataset, the significant predictors of "D_FINANCE_UPTAKE" are "Value_Money" (p = 0.036), "Involvement_With_Money" (p = 0.026), and "MASPS" (p = 0.001).\nIn the updated dataset, the significant predictors of "ln_Digital_Finance_Uptake" are "Value_Money" (p = 0.002), "Involvement_With_Money" (p = 0.004), "SMH" (p = 0.034), and "MASPS" (p < 0.001).\nThe variable "MASPS" is significant in both datasets but with opposite signs (negative in the original dataset and positive in the updated dataset).\nThe variable "SMH" is significant only in the updated dataset.\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA): \nFor the original dataset, the F-statistic (F(7, 40) = 3.07) is significant (p = 0.0110), indicating that the overall regression model is significant.\nFor the updated dataset, the F-statistic (F(7, 60) = 11.22) is highly significant (p < 0.0001), suggesting a stronger overall regression model.\nThe R-squared value for the updated dataset (0.5669) is higher than the R-squared value for the original dataset (0.3496), indicating that the updated model explains a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable.\nIn summary, the main differences between the two datasets lie in the significant predictors identified in the regression analyses and the overall strength of the regression models (as indicated by the F-statistics and R-squared values).

With equitable access to growth opportunities and advocacy, staff retention thrives.\nAs a caregiver-centric workplace, Dakota recognizes that nurturing staff well-being precipitates superior patient experiences. Policies supporting healthy work-life integration include enhanced medical leave, flexible scheduling, remote work arrangements, and part-time tracks that exceed national standards. Yang, Henthorne and George(2019) postulates that recent initiatives like predictive analytics-based float pool management and AI-assisted shift swapping based on skills transferability and peer compatibility allow more responsive scheduling control at an individual level without compromising unit-level regulatory coverage.\nOnsite amenities reinforce holistic support via counseling, nutrition guidance, massage, and childcare for parents working long shifts. Dakota also offers customized guidance on managing compassion fatigue and emotional resilience to protect against burnout. This infrastructure enables balance and renewal aligned with personal needs, so staff satisfaction continues rising.\nAlongside programming expanding access and wellness, Dakota focuses considerable resources on embedding ethical accountability at all levels. Required ethics training utilizes relatable case examples relevant to everyday choices around integrity, anti-discrimination, privacy, and harm reduction. Policies clearly outline expected conduct and consequences for violations centered on restorative justice. Dakota\'s peer-based Ethics Review Board, comprised of diverse hospital voices, investigates reported grievances and recommends resolutions upholding dignity by recognizing all staff roles as collective stewards of patient trust and safety. Dakota\'s collaborative enforcement of sound moral practices maintains standards organization-wide.\n3.0 Critical Analysis\nDakota Deluxe Leeds has extensively publicized its investments in environmental and social responsibility across nearly all facets of hospitality. As a luxury hotel, its high-profile sustainability programs warrant scrutiny regarding implementation integrity and transformational impacts on local communities and ecosystems. While specific initiatives like direct regional sourcing partnerships appear genuinely impactful, others may risk accusations of greenwashing if analyzed under a critical lens.\n3.1 Sustainable Sourcing Commitments  \nDakota Deluxe\'s sustainable sourcing commitments, particularly its hyperlocal supply chain connecting the hotel\'s Michelin-starred restaurant with over 50 nearby farms and vendors, have garnered acclaim. However, the assertion of "exclusive partnerships" lacks validation due to a lack of data transparency on supplier qualifications. To demonstrate sustainable sourcing, Dakota Deluxe must provide visibility into its supplier selection process, including confirmation of regenerative growing practices through third-party audits. Despite this caveat, the emphasis on seasonal fluctuations and regional ingredients is likely more efficacious in reducing transportation emissions than imported alternatives. \nThe hotel\'s commitment aligns with environmental sustainability goals, but the extent of this impact requires quantification and transparent communication. Socially, sharing the network of local producers encourages patron engagement with Leeds\' foodscape, benefiting area purveyors through increased visibility and demand. However, the hotel must ensure fair and transparent engagement with local communities. Financially, the positive patron engagement and emphasis on quality and local ingredients may positively impact the hotel\'s brand image and customer satisfaction. The program\'s current positives could eclipse skepticism if supplier verification becomes forthcoming, emphasizing the need to commit to genuine sustainable sourcing through third-party audits and transparent practices. \n3.2 Eco-Tourism Programming\nSimilar to its sourcing policies, Dakota Deluxe\'s eco-tourism forays achieve modest sustainability progress but require more systematic rigor to satisfy critics. Its overnight nature excursions connect visitors to Yorkshire\'s landscapes; however, more details need to be published on how these tours measurably support at-risk habitats. Are preserved acres directly tied to specific species population gains? Do tours uphold Leave No Trace principles or monitor attendee behaviors? Dakota Deluxe must demonstrate tangible conservation impacts at sponsored reserves to appease accusations of eco-exploitation.\nThat noted informational materials on low-impact transportation options and easily accessible green spaces provide actionable guidance for mindful tourism. Region-specific customization shows strategy beyond boilerplate advice, although monitoring guest adoption rates could bolster claims of genuine influence on visitor environmental behaviors.\n3.3 Waste and Emissions Reduction\nDakota Deluxe Leeds\' waste diversion rates and aggregated emissions cuts constitute definite environmental progress, although the lack of periodic auditing leaves program integrity dependent on hotel self-assessments.The external analysis would determine if stated pollution and landfill reductions align with atmosphere-level improvements (Ben Youssef and Zeqiri, 2022). Still, infrastructure upgrades like low-watt lighting and automated building systems require significant upfront investments —likely negating suggestions of disingenuous greenwashing. \nOngoing performance tracking via energy management analytics and waste composition analyses would further validate Dakota Deluxe\'s waste minimization claims. Transparent public benchmarking against competitors would signal accountability above and beyond PR spin. However, building-level sustainability upgrades likely stimulate positive financial and environmental returns.\n3. Labor and Inclusion Policies\nIn a critical analysis of Dakota Deluxe Leeds\' labor and inclusion policies, the effectiveness and genuineness of these practices come under scrutiny, focusing on determining whether they are genuinely sustainable or potentially veiled marketing gimmicks, often referred to as \'greenwashing.\' The hotel\'s exceptional worker retention is highlighted as a positive indicator, suggesting that fair labor standards are ingrained structurally rather than merely symbolic. The recognition of industry evidence supporting the link between ethical employment practices and reduced turnover and absenteeism strengthens the argument for the genuine effectiveness of these policies.\nRobust diversity programs also signal the hotel\'s commitment to combating discrimination within its workforce. However, demographic data about the authenticity of claims regarding an inclusive culture needs to be more accurate, emphasizing the need for comprehensive validation. To ensure sustainability and authenticity, Dakota Deluxe should establish public equity benchmarks and consistently report representation metrics across all staff levels, providing transparency and accountability.\nDetermining whether the current policies translate into proportionate community impacts across Leeds’ socioeconomic spectrum through local partner audits is also essential (Youssef and Zeqiri, 2022). This step is crucial for validating the hotel\'s commitment to inclusivity beyond its internal operations. Despite these challenges, the hotel\'s ambitious social infrastructure, which exceeds regulatory requirements, reflects a laudable prioritization of justice within its business practices.\nWhile Dakota Deluxe Leeds demonstrates positive strides in fair labor standards and diversity programs, the lack of specific data elements and the need for external validation pose challenges to the overall genuineness of these practices. The hotel\'s commitment to transparency, equity benchmarks, and community impact assessments will play a pivotal role in determining the sustainability and authenticity of its labor and inclusion policies.\n3.6 Overall Assessment\nDakota Deluxe Leeds has taken laudable steps to embed sustainability with evidence of internal and local tangible transformation in areas like waste diversion and employment culture. Its food and eco-tourism initiatives similarly display positives but require added transparency around supplier qualifications and conservation efficacy. Providing visibility into oversight procedures and outcomes would dispel lingering greenwashing concerns.\nComprehensive tracking and routine auditing of environmental and social progress enable the genuine cultivation of community goodwill. Though admirably outpacing competitors, Dakota Deluxe must continue striving for new hospitality sector standards across ethical procurement, ecological regeneration, diversity advancement, and local economic participation. Its current foundation sets the stage for industry leadership — if backed by accountability.\n4.0 Predicting Future Trends\nHospitality sits squarely at the intersection of multiple global challenges, from climate volatility to freshwater access limits confronting society in the coming years. For Leeds\' flagship luxury property Dakota Deluxe, iterating ahead of projections across environmental stewardship, social ethics, transparency, and local community resilience presents simultaneous obstacles and leadership openings carrying into 2030. \nAs planetary tipping points loom ever closer, radically reimagining sustainable hospitality reflects self-preservation instincts and the duty to shepherd society toward regeneration. By preemptively surfing waves of change, Dakota Deluxe can model pathways for regional properties at all levels to participate in restoration.\n4.1 Climate Impacts Across Hospitality\nAmong the numerous pending shifts climate impacts will stimulate for hospitality, altering tourism seasons and flows present significant adaptation challenges. Warming winters and extreme heat events will concentrate travelers\' interest in the fall and spring months. Peak visitation periods currently centered around summer holidays will likely shift earlier into May and June as temperatures surge past comfortable thresholds. \nAdditionally, disasters like flooding or wildfires may sporadically restrict regional access during the summers (Hotels, 2022). To balance visitor traffic across months, Dakota Deluxe must expand shoulder season offerings to smooth financial volatility from climate swings. Opportunities exist to develop autumn food festivals or wellness retreats, building climate resilience during previously down months.\nFor Dakota Deluxe Leeds, visitor bookings concentrated from June to August will progressively compact towards late spring as regional temperatures regularly breach 25°C during traditional summer months. School holiday blocks previously correlating with busy occupancy periods will mismatch shifting climate-induced tourist flows. Financial planning around high seasons will grow unreliable, and strategies that pivot toward climate resilience will be absent.\n4.2 Circular Resource Management \nHeightened climate disruptions will also make comprehensive resource circulation and waste elimination mandatory. As societies globally face intensifying resource contention, eliminating leakage across operational flows will grow in financial and social importance. Dakota Deluxe must build upon current waste diversion efforts by establishing full circularity across the water, energy, and solid waste domains. \n Expanding on site solar and geothermal sources while tightly regulating consumption will enhance self-sufficiency. Existing practices like composting, incumbent sensor lighting, and rainwater collection should scale into integrated systems that recycle water, balance ambient temperatures, and power facilities. Moreover, the hotel can lead regional decarbonization and regeneration by hosting forums for properties citywide to develop circular programs jointly.\nAs younger generations increasingly scrutinize corporate climate policy before purchasing decisions, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability will become a prerequisite for attracting patronage. Surveys show 60% of Millennials class environmental ethics among hotel selection criteria compared to 32% of Baby Boomers (Partners, 2022). Additionally, visible emissions disclosures and verified progress indicators will become basic hospitality hygiene factors rather than differentiators before 2030. \nTo satisfy visitor expectations for climate consciousness, Dakota Deluxe will need to pursue net zero status through rigorous modeling, offset purchasing, and, ultimately, eliminate residual emissions outright. As expectations rise, displaying ongoing measurement-based reduction plans becomes critical to maintaining market viability.\n4.3 Mainstreaming of Localism and Equity \nIn addition to climate awareness, changing attitudes around ethical consumption stand to alter hospitality in the coming years. Younger travelers exhibit an escalating preference for locales offering sustainable operations and evidenced commitment to economic and racial justice through hiring, sourcing, and community building. \nAccording to (Nilson and Thorell, 2018), there are 20 categories and certifications highlighting area-specific heritage preservation to give way to new frameworks validating regional equity contributions; Dakota Deluxe must assess its holistic influence on disadvantaged populations. Are frontline neighborhoods benefitting financially? What ownership roles exist for immigrant or minority residents around decisions, profits, or power? Demonstrable justice commitments beyond PR slogans will soon constitute mainstream requirements.\nForecasts additionally predict continued mass adoption of wellness-centric hospitality offerings, blurring lines between tourism, nutrition, and therapeutic realms.(Partners, 2022) Market reports envision over 15% average yearly growth in wellness tourism through the coming years as Millennial travellers treat self-care as essential rather than indulgent. \n(Support the article it is effect - Reference that)\nFor Dakota Deluxe, myriad openings exist to pioneer regional well-being packages spanning visitor nutrition guidance, restorative treatments, and nature-immersive relaxation while upholding medical ethics. As psychological and physiological health concerns accelerate, distinctive restoration programs leveraging Dakota Deluxe\'s amenities could create desired destination separation. Administrative partnerships with area therapists, organic farmers, and wellness coaches help assemble comprehensive offerings.\n4.4 Technology Implications \nA pivotal capability allowing hotels to fulfil rising consumer transparency demands relates to climate accounting technologies continuously measuring, reporting, and reducing emissions enterprise-wide. Dakota Deluxe should implement integrated tracking functionality quantifying usage volumes, operational emissions, and lifecycle production impacts across departments.\nData inputs encompassing water utilization figures of distribution losses generate holistic environmental audits while identifying optimization areas. Granular metrics analyzing commercial laundry kilowatt demands, kitchen refrigeration outputs, and room comfort preferences focus reduction plans. When embedded in guest interfaces, visibility into respective trip footprints nudges accountability. As analytics reveal full emissions histories, neutralization investments become simply transactional.  \nBuilding infrastructure will also require increased weatherproofing to handle intensified flooding, winds, and temperature variability from climate change. Assessments projecting location-specific climate impacts through 2040 help determine necessary resiliency upgrades like reinforced perimeter barriers, redundant power microgrids, upgraded drainage systems, and expanded HVAC capacities ahead of liveability thresholds. With weather disasters sharpening in regularity, proactive iteration of structural reinforcements positions Dakota Deluxe to maintain operational continuity where others falter.\n4.5 AI Optimization and Predictions \nSophisticated AI solutions will allow Dakota Deluxe to maximize operational efficiency through environmental IoT sensors, predictive data modeling, and machine learning. Smart climate grids balancing solar heat and cooling, passive ventilation, and zonal preferences economize energy outlays while preserving comfort (Yang, Henthorne and George, 2019). Guest interface integration lets visitors visualize the energy consequences of custom comfort requests in real-time.\nMachine vision capable of identifying and rectifying resource leaks early slashes waste and utility costs. Meanwhile, predictive algorithms that anticipate variability in local weather patterns, visitor attendance, and kitchen ingredient demands enhance department preparedness. Rather than reactive measures, continuously optimized automation through AI fundamentally changes hospitality management.\n4.6 Food System Stabilization  \nTechnological innovation around agriculture and nitrification will equally influence Hospitality operations as climate volatility threatens food systems. As resource economics incentivize stabilized localization, Dakota Deluxe should invest in regional players like vertical growers, urban farmers, and algae producers, reversing supply fragility through innovation. Partners powering regenerative projects through purchasing contracts or equity positions seed community resilience.\nOnsite technologies like aeroponic and mycoprotein bioreactors that enable self-sufficiency reduce procurement costs while benefiting regional stability. Instead of just sourcing ethically, direct participation in nurturing community food futures creates differentiation. Prioritizing partnerships, explicitly working to elevate ownership opportunities for immigrants and disadvantaged groups, multiplies positive change.\n4.7 Social Ethics Management\nTo satisfy rising consumer emphasis on racial equity and economic inclusion, hospitality operators like Dakota Deluxe will rely on emerging centralized certification frameworks to communicate workplace policies, supplier codes, and community-building measures. Rather than fragmented indicators, indexed badges validating measurable commitments across the environment, community, and governance convey trust and transparency.\nThird-party auditors confirming responsible regional participation will provide credibility to Asahi\'s costly marketing facades. Crowdsourced reporting further strengthens the reliability of public evaluations. Standardized DEI analytics quantifying retention statistics, promotion equity, and compensation fairness across employee demographics assist internal improvement efforts within organizations. Verified ratings synthesizing multifaceted justice components boil down complex challenges into accessible meters of conscience.\n4.8 The Next Era of Sustainable Hospitality\nFundamentally, climate change, consumer shifts, and technology advances will mandate complete hospitality reenvisioning through lenses of resilience, regeneration, and collective prosperity. Incremental improvements no longer suffice. In every facet, from guest experience to infrastructure to community role, genuine foresight and leadership means reorienting around ecological restoration and social healing. \nNo singular formula decrees precise sustainable hospitality features in 2030 or beyond. However, the central challenge for Dakota Deluxe and its peers remains to create pathways that benefit all living beings and systems within reach. If circular resource management, climate positivity frameworks, and cooperative community enrichment ultimately shape regional dynamics, both people and planet progress.\nBy proactively raising ambitions, braiding technology tools with cultural dialogue, and centering justice in every initiative, Dakota Deluxe can actualize sustainable hospitality that nurtures and delights equally. The opportunity exists to steer the industry towards becoming a distinguishing force, enabling a thriving society built on ethics of life. The moment to begin writing this next chapter persists now.\n5.0 Recommendation\n5.1 Renewable Energy Transition\nDakota Deluxe Leeds should formulate actionable roadmaps to source 100% offsite electricity from regional wind and solar generation to achieve genuine carbon neutrality. On-location renewables like geothermal, solar panels, and microgrids must expand from supplementary to primary facility power sources. Dakota Deluxe can provide accountability through routine progress tracking by establishing milestones every 2 years for utilization growth, grid independence, and emissions offsetting.\n5.2 Circular Water Systems  \nAggressive targets to establish on location water capture, filtering, and reuse techniques should aim for less than 10% municipal sourcing within 5-7 years. Initiatives like comprehensive rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, lavatory sensor faucets, and thoughtful drought-resistant landscaping can meet daily usage needs onsite. Regular water audits help identify distribution losses and usage analytics refine conservation tactics. An interlink with the Leeds River would serve solely for emergency backup once internally closed-loop processes are perfected.  \n5.3 Racial Equity Contracting Minimums\nFor capital projects, Dakota Deluxe should adhere to mandates steering a minimum of 50% of initiative financing to firms substantively Black or minority-owned with verified inclusive hiring records. Whether engaging technology vendors, construction contractors, or professional services, preferential selection supports wealth building for marginalized groups. Proactive outreach programs would foster candidate pipelines from disadvantaged communities.  \n5.4 The Planet Commitments  \nDakota Deluxe should commit 1% of its annual revenues towards charitable initiatives advancing regional conservation and climate efforts to catalyze sustainable change. Beyond one-time donations, sustained participation in ecological regeneration programs creates solidarity with local groups. Funds could revive public green spaces, sponsor clean energy startups led by underrepresented founders, or support sustainable agriculture innovators specifically assisting immigrants or people of color.\n5.5 Responsible Tourism Certification  \nPursuing leading designations like Green Destinations or Sustainable Tourism Eco-Certification builds credibility while setting operational standards to protect local heritage. Compliance requirements around resource use caps, biodiversity enrichment, living wages, and visitor stewardship responsibility ensure tourism sustains rather than erodes regional vitality over time. Renewing certifications every two years would benchmark continual improvement on key indicators.\nTo uplift economic mobility for nearby disadvantaged communities, Dakota Deluxe should pioneer profit-sharing partnerships with local social enterprises addressing sustainability challenges. Joint initiatives could help refugee-led urban farms fund renewable tech or enable community-based cooperatives to launch eco-education programs. Beyond one-off donations, co-investing to grow regenerative projects rooted in social justice accelerates systemic change.  \nBy embracing complete resource circulation, equitable community development, and tourism measured against ecological enrichment, Dakota Deluxe Leeds can pioneer principled hospitality where sustainability, justice, and accessibility coexist. The emerging Future compels bold aspirations, transforming ephemeral words into daily, measurable, positive change over the next decade.\n6.0 Reflection on AI\'s Role\nAs artificial intelligence and data analytics expand across industries, hospitality sectors like Dakota Deluxe Leeds increasingly utilize emerging technologies to inform sustainability initiatives. When thoughtfully directed, AI-enabled assessment can strengthen policies through precision insights, uncovering unseen usage patterns and systemic blind spots. However, minimally governed analytics risk entrenching partial perspectives, further marginalizing social groups, or even obscuring the fuller measures of holistic sustainability.\n6.1 Processing Strengths \nIndeed, for properties like Dakota Deluxe, AI and processing engines excel at continuously optimizing energy, water, and waste flows using environmental sensor feeds, usage metrics, and predictive modeling(Khaliq et al., 2022). Data platforms integrating service requests, power outputs, and operational demands allow contextual response in areas like dynamic temperature regulation and resource savings. Machine learning algorithms tracking guest activity patterns facilitate preemptive adjustments to lighting, HVAC zonal calibration, and preventative leak detection.\nThese autonomous efficiencies amplify human capabilities alone, providing 24/7 responsive energy, emissions, and reliability management, surpassing manual oversight. When analysis incorporates lifecycle production inputs within supply chains, holistic impact modeling guides procurement and design innovation. Dakota Deluxe\'s recent biodegradable to-go container switch stemmed directly from such assessment, inviting further supplier evaluations.\n6.2 Sociocultural Limits  \nHowever, reliance solely on computational optimization risks narrow interpretations of hospitality sustainability within sociocultural contexts. Metrics centering ecological impacts leave unaddressed deeper connections between environmental and social justice. Absent those larger frames, AI cannot surmise how technical interventions might ignore or even worsen inequities faced by marginalized communities.\nFor example, data processing naturally gravitates solutions towards installing profitable renewable microgrids since emission figures overwhelm associated concerns like whether such upgrades expand locals\' ownership roles or energy access. However, sustainability fundamentally links equitable power distribution, enabling community resilience against oppressive systems. Without continually positioning technical inputs alongside participative dialogue, AI shortchanges hospitality\'s true regenerative obligations.\n6.3 Binary Tendencies  \nMoreover, algorithmic processing exhibits natural affinities for binary designations that belie the nuanced fluidity underlying genuine sustainability. Rating systems sifting enterprises into absolute categories like \'sustainable/not\' or \'ethical/unethical\' conflict with necessary context sensitivity. How can static badges communicate multi-layered challenges around justly transitioning regional food systems or accommodating diverse visitor needs? Within a singular firm like Dakota Deluxe, compartmentalized data on housekeeping resource usage often obscures the fuller picture of human well-being policies upholding staff dignity across jobs (Khaliq et al., 2022). Rather than sorting features absolutely, authentic sustainability demands nuance.\n6.4 Corrective Guidelines  \nTherefore, when applying AI capabilities for research and planning, Dakota Deluxe must center participative processes and cultural dialogue as much as datasets to avoid narrow interpretations. Representative community panels and inclusive internal exchanges should frequently revisit analysis to determine the potential exclusion of critical contexts. Just as regular sensor recalibrations improve data quality, recurrent collective recalibrations of evaluative models against on-the-ground realities enrich the understanding of sustainability over relying purely on computational logic.\nResponsible AI integration also requires transparency regarding any omitted variables from assessment matrices and perceptible avenues to address gaps. If overall hotel sustainability scores are generated, acknowledging missing metrics around regional economic impact or workforce inclusion enables improvement. Identifying limitations allows technology and cultural knowledge to play complementary, iterative roles in sustaining ethical hospitality.\n6.5 Shared Future  \nUltimately, through balanced usage emphasizing pluralistic participation, artificial intelligence can help uncover novel solutions while spurring hospitality properties towards justice-based sustainability otherwise unseen (Khaliq et al., 2022). So long as the technology remains bonded to community co-governance, Dakota Deluxe and Leeds hospitality can lead to regional regeneration where economic mobility, ecological health, and social equity fertilize together. Blending compassionate human truths with AI\'s indefatigable precision promises a sustainable future for all.\n7.0 Conclusion\nDakota Deluxe Leeds has become a hospitality sustainability leader through comprehensive environmental and ethical programming. From onsite aquaponics to regenerative dining partnerships with over 50 regional farms, Dakota Deluxe interweaves green stewardship into every facet of its award-winning service and refined aesthetic. Its innovative thinking redefines luxury hospitality\'s boundaries by proving eco-consciousness and social empowerment can coexist with, and even enhance, indulgence when grounded in preserving communal and ecological wellbeing. \nThe critical analysis of Dakota Deluxe revealed commendable initiatives but highlighted areas for improvement in data transparency and external validation. The broader industry landscape showcased a mix of genuine efforts and potential \'greenwashing,\' emphasizing the importance of transparency and equity benchmarks. Predictions for the next decade foresee increased emphasis on verifiable sustainability claims and practices like eco-friendly initiatives and community engagement. While laudable, Dakota recognizes sustainability as an ongoing journey demanding continuous engagement with emerging accountability frameworks and local partners to grow impact. Its multipronged efforts tackling everything from supply chain transparency to low-emissions travel packages demonstrate that with ethics at its core, the hospitality industry can nurture our world\'s precious places and people so we may continue enjoying them for the long haul. Dakota Deluxe remains an aspirational leader steering the industry toward conscientious luxury.', '\n\n\nWomen, Peace, and Security In Somalia\n\nName:\n\nInstitution: \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe issue of Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) is a global challenge affecting communities that experience frequent wars, internal conflicts, and political insurrections. The need to prevent violence and conflicts against women is one of the goals of the United Nations through its United Nations United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325: Participation, Protection, Prevention, Relief and Recovery that aims at enhancing gender mainstreaming in peacebuilding through participation of women in WPS programs. Somalia presents a case example of a country that has been significantly impacted by conflicts and violence against women. The Office of National Security (ONS) of Somalia aims at finding solutions to the issue of violence against women as an initiative for peacebuilding and enhancement of the general security of its citizens. This paper presents the current overview of the issue of WPS, its goals and objectives; the current state of women security in Somalia and the challenges encountered; a recommendation of solutions that can be implemented to reduce conflicts that have negative impacts on women; and the implementation plan for various initiatives to achieve full security of women in Somalia and their participation in community development initiatives. The methodology implementedd is the secondary analysis of existing scholarly publications such as books and journals. From the results, it is noted that the issue of conflicts against women can be best addressed by increasing multi-stakeholder participation in peacebuilding initiatives and gender mainstreaming programs that are based on the UNSRC 1325 pillars of protection, participation, prevention, and relief and recovery efforts. This framework ensures the elimination of discrimination against women while promoting their involvement in such areas as WPS policymaking, peacekeeping workforce, training in the management of peacekeeping programs, and acting as advisors in post-armed conflicts reconstruction programs. \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nINTRODUCTION\nBackground \nAccording to International Laws, women have equal rights as men in all aspects of social, political, and economic activities in a social setting. However, studies show that women have been subjected to violence in many aspects of social life and sometimes discrimination in their families, communities, and countries. There are high chances that women are less likely to be involved in peacebuilding initiatives after conflicts while during conflicts, they are more likely to be physically harmed, raped, and infected with HIV/AIDs compared with men. The United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 was a groundbreaking resolution that recognized the significance of protecting women against violence, preventing discriminatory laws and practices in the society, involvement of women in peacebuilding initiatives because they are at higher risk of being subjected to violence and discrimination. Many civil society stakeholders have emerged advocating for the implementation of the UNSCR 1325 with the focus on peacebuilding and reduction of the effects of conflicts on vulnerable populations such as women. A resolution was reached on October 24, 2000, by 40 UN member states that they would support gender mainstreaming efforts, peace operations, and increased participation of women in peace processes. The Council also discussed the issue of armed conflict on women and the opportunities of women participation in peace processes. The participants included women representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in developing countries such as Sierra Leone, Somalia, Guatemala, and Zambia. Somalia is at a key stage, dealing with various challenges like internal conflicts, terrorist activities, poverty, and Gender inequality. Among these, involving women in keeping the peace and enhancing security is both ethical and a smart approach. The United Nations Security Council brought this issue into focus when they approved Rule 1325 of Woman peace and security in 2000. This regulation spotlighted the special hardships women endure in conflicts and their limited voice in peace discussions. It also urged for the crucial role of women in stopping and resolving conflicts. In 2015, Somalia made moves to put these UN recommendations into practice by adopting its first national plan of action. Yet, the country still encounters big hurdles in fully involving women in its strategies for peace and security. Given Somalia\'s unstable past, filled with constant conflicts, the role that Somali women could play in solving these issues remains an untapped resource. This document is designed to steer governmental decisions to fully back and push forward the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) initiatives within the country. This practical guide targets state officials, organizations outside of the government, and international allies who are dedicated to progressing the WPS mission. The Office of National Security of Somalia is asked with the responsibility of enhancing security of the country in all aspects and preventing possible harm to women during unstable political climate such as internal conflicts, civil wars, inter-tribal wars, and domestic conflicts. It is appropriate the right framework should be formulated for prevention of violence against women in Somalia, protecting them against risk factors for violence, enhancing their participation in violence prevention programs, and providing the necessary relief to women who have been victims of violence. The effectiveness of the Officer of National Security in prevention of violence against women is dependent on the strategic effectiveness of the formulated program. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the current state the United Nations Mission towards the issue of WPS, the current state of violence against women in Somalia and the efforts and challenges encountered in the effort to address the issue, a recommendation of solutions that need to be implemented to address the issue, and the implementation plan for its successful implementation by the Office or National Security.\nObjectives of the Report \nThe objectives of this reports include the following: \nTo describe the current agenda of WPS globally and in Somalian context.\nTo describe the current state of violence against women in Somalia, the efforts that have been made to address the issue, and the challenges encountered.\nTo formulate the recommendations for addressing WPS in Somalia in accordance with the UN United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325. \nTo formulate an implementation plan for the recommendations, identify timelines, and indicators of success of the initiative.\nWOMEN AND THE CONTEMPORARY ARMED CONFLICTS\nArmed conflicts are social issues experienced in many countries in developing economies in Africa with one quarter of the countries experiencing conflicts since the late 1990s. Presently, armed conflicts is generally internal with the impacts being experienced at the regional and sub-regional levels. Victims of such armed conflicts are more likely to be those who are more likely to be women, children, and other vulnerable groups. In many contemporary armed conflicts, mass displacement occurs with the displaced citizens being subjected to insecurity, gender-based violence (GBV) sexual violence, and religious violence. Civilians have been greatly impacted by such incidences of violence. Increased infiltration of lethal weapons has further worsened the severity of violence committed by armed groups. The experience that women and girls undergo during armed conflicts is associated with their status in the society. While everyone in a community is at risk of suffering the consequences of violence and terrorism, women and girls are at higher risk because they do not enjoy equal status in the society as men. While women and girls are likely to experience violence prior to conflicts, these experiences are exacerbated during conflicts. Since women are usually excluded from decision-making activities, the resolutions reached in peacebuilding may not necessarily represent their interests and needs. Women and girls are considered bearers of cultural identity and thus are more likely to be targeted during armed conflicts. Many armed groups are likely to subject women victims to various forms of GBV such as sexual violation, psychological violence, forced abortion, impregnation, sexual trafficking, and infection with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Some women may not only be victims, but also act as agents in conflicts in which violence against women are committed because of their loyalty to political, cultural, or religious groups. They may provide support to armed groups by cooking, acting as porters for the soldiers, acting as messengers, and cleaning. Some may escalate violence by encouraging their children to take part in armed conflicts. The challenge is that there is lack of effective development of women agency in peacebuilding and reduction of violence against women because of their lack of participation in many peace processes such as negotiations, development of peace accords, and community reconstruction plans after conflicts. In few cases where women have participated in peacebuilding processes, they have brought women perspectives to the peace development process. \nUnited Nations Mission on WPS\nThe United Nations Mission to address the issues of WPS is broadly categorized into four pillars: participation and representation, prevention, and relief and recovery. The pillar of participation focuses on creating an enabling environment for women to participate in decision-making initiatives relating to peacebuilding and resolution of conflicts at the national, local, and international levels. It recommends the inclusion of women in conflict resolution programs, appointment of women negotiators, peacekeeping forces, humanitarian support personnel, police officers. The pillar or protection of women against violence recommends that the rights of women and girls should be protected in areas affected by violence. There is specific emphasis on protection of internally displaced women when armed conflicts occur. The protection given to women should be exclusive because women need a different type of protection from men. The goal of prevention involves integrating gender needs of women into early preparedness for violence and conflicts that could result in increased cases of violence against them. It also involves the inclusion of women in conflict prevention and initiatives to eradicate possession of illegal arms. Gender based violence (GBV) should also be addressed through prevention programs. Discriminatory social practices and attitudes towards women is also in the category of GBV prevention efforts. The aspect of relief and recovery focuses on ensuring the specific needs of women and girls are met through repatriation programs for displaced women, resettlement for internally displaced women, disarmament of communities where cases of violence against women are high and providing basic needs support for IDP women. This pillar also emphasizes on enhancing the capacity of women to act as relief agents in violence prevention initiatives. The issue of armed conflicts, sexual violence against women, and increased risks of HIV/AID exposure has been at the center of the UN discussion leading to the adoption of the Security Council Resolution 1308 (2000) on HIV/AIDS prevention during UN peacekeeping operations. Many intergovernmental agencies have incorporated gender perspectives in their activities, such as the Security Council and the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. \nThe need to include women in peacekeeping operations was established in 2000 by a high-Panel convened by the UN Secretary General.  The UN Security Council has previously sought to collaborate with women’s groups in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to get information on the status of women and girls’ security. Many peace processes have included women’s views from NGOs in areas adversely affected by wars such as Afghanistan, Guatemala, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Because of increased warfare and conflicts, the UN recognized the significance of women’s participation in peace and security issues aimed at achieving long-term stability. In October 31, 2000 UNSCR 1325 was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council. Thus, resolution established the state of disproportionate impacts of armed conflicts on women and girls and recommended the implementation of gender perspectives that account for the needs of women and girls during peace missions such as repatriation, rehabilitation, resettlement, and reintegration of women into the society during post-war recovery initiatives. This resolution has four pillars: protection of women, prevention of violence against women, increasing participation of women in peacebuilding activities, and relief and inclusion of women perspectives during relief and recovery activities after armed conflicts. \nTHE WPS AGENDA\nThe WPS has been the UN’s high priority area as in response to increased cases of armed conflicts that affect women and girls. Several commissions have been formed to address the issues of armed conflicts and violence. An example is the 1969 Commission on the Status of Women that investigated whether the UN peacekeeping forces needed to provide special protection to women and children during armed conflicts and emergency situations. Another act formed by the UN was that Declaration on Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict in 1974. During a Conference on Women in 1975 in Mexico, it was noted that involvement of women in peacebuilding efforts can result in constructive outcomes in the efforts to address armed conflict issues. Many other legislations were passed by the UN in the 1980s and conferences were held to discuss the impacts of armed conflicts on women, formulate the way forward for achieving global peace, and enhance security. The need to address violence against women was supported by the findings of the Commission of Experts in a study on the Yugoslavian conflict where several incidences of violation of international law were reported, including more than 1,100 cases of sexual violence. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was enacted in 1993 during the Vienna Conference in Austria. In the 1995 Beijing’s Fourth World Conference on Women, it was recommended that violence against women is one of the 12 critical issues that the UN member states needed to address. Paragraph 44 of the Beijing Platform for Action recommended that governments, NGOS, the civil society, and the international community needed to collaborate to address the issue of armed conflicts against women. The issue of WPS gained considerable attention after the adoption of the UNSCR 1325 which emphasized the prevention of sexual violence against women during armed conflicts. However, the resolution has been criticized for furthering the male gender as perpetrators of sexual violence and women as victims. WPS has also been associated with the limitation of diverting attention from long-term efforts of preventing conflicts to prevention of sexual violence against women. Another limitation is that WPS efforts have not brought considerable change in masculinities evident in the peacekeeping operations, which still illustrates the existence of gender bias. Presently, of the 125,000 peacekeeping forces, women constitute only 3% of the military personnel and 15% of the police force. This shows that the resolution still has a long way to go in its implementation. Another challenge that has been encountered in in addressing WPS is the institutional and systemic barriers that have undermined the agenda. These include neo-liberal economic systems, global proliferation of arms, terrorist systems, and systems for preventing violent extremism. The WPS agenda has been viewed from the perspective of the feminist political economy (FPE) which argues that the WPS agenda can be addressed when attention is directed towards long-term conflict prevention mechanisms by incorporating gendered globalized structures that reduce the probability of conflicts such as reduction of gender-biased macroeconomic policies, labor markets, and political practices. Another perspective of WPS is the need to focus on the economic aspect of engendering peacebuilding efforts. According to this perspective, the participation of women in peacebuilding majorly depends on the extent to which they are economically and socially empowered. Another perspective has recommended that WPS agenda is achievable when the grassroot organizations are empowered to contribute to peacebuilding by financing their activities and enhancing their interaction with international actors. \nCurrent Status of WPS in Somalia \nThe status of WPS in Somalia is characterized by increased GBV against women due to high number of armed conflicts. It is predominantly an Islam country where cultural practices are influenced by Islamic laws and norms. Many women are at high risk of being subjected to GBV such as domestic violence, sexual violence, psychological violence, physical violence, rape, etc.  Incidences of GBV continued to be on the rise due to an increase in the number of displaced women during armed conflicts such as the war between the civilians and the Al-Shabaab and the Somali Civil War. Other factors that have increased the risk of GBV include floods and drought. Many natural disasters occur in Somalia which further increase the risk of GBV against women and girls. Insecurity and reduced mobility have been worsened by inefficient electoral processes and power struggles among political actors. Persistent famine has led to increased food insecurity that has exposed women and girls to alarming state of economic deprivation, a factor that further increases their vulnerability to GBV. Drought in Somalia has led to the displacement of more than 600,000 people in Somalia. The displaced people live nomadic lifestyle which increases the risk of GBV and sexual harassment of women and girls when they are on the move. Increasing food prices, conflict over scarce resources, and little humanitarian support has caused significant interruption of the market system and affected the livelihood of many Somalian citizens. Long duration of draught in Somalia has resulted in large scale crop failure, and increased food insecurity. Many women and girls have been exposed to rape, harassment, and sexual exploitation as they search for economic opportunities to sustain their lives. The state of camps where Internally Displaced People (IDPS) live have poor conditions such as long distance from water points, inadequate healthcare facilities, poor lighting, lack of secure housing structures, disaggregation of sanitary services which further increases the risk of GBV against girls and women. \n\tWPS efforts in Somalia have suffered a setback of impunity for perpetrators of sexual violence, gender-based violence acts because any solution to such acts depends on clan-based decisions. Incidences of domestic violence against women are solved by male members of households such as a woman’s father or husband. If a resolution is reached that no offense has been committed, such women victims never get justice for acts of violence against them. In many areas of Somalia, the justice systems operate according to Islamic laws and culture. The legal situation of women is dependent on whether the Islamic laws are violated. Justice to victims of rape is less likely to be achieved when acts committed against them are acceptable in the Islamic culture. While the UNSCR 1325 and Resolution 1820 recommend prevention of sexual violence against women, there are no Institutions in Somalia where women can seek justice if they have been subjected to GBV such as rape. It is suggested that one of the ways in which these issues can be addressed is to increase Somali women’s participation in peace processes. This will ensure gender-based crimes such as rape and domestic violence are reported and addressed. The Somali cultural law, the Sha ‘aria law and legal systems empower male counterparts to make decisions on behalf of their wives. Both the Islamic Laws and the Somaly customary Xeer Laws empower male members of a family such as a father, a husband, or a male relative to be in control of women. The implication is the assumption that male members of a family have the authority to make all decisions on behalf of women. This further increases the risk of exposure to sexual violence such as when such decisions are made by male individuals with malicious objectives such as sexual violation. The sharia Laws also prohibit women from owning property, thus making many women economically dependent on men. Little economic empowerment of many Somali women exposes them to dependence on male individuals such as their husbands or fathers who may exploit them sexually. The pastoralist lifestyle of many Somalian women such as agriculture and fishing expose them to insecurity where they are at high risk of being raped and sexually harassed by their acquaintances while limiting their contribution to peacebuilding initiatives. Therefore, it is necessary that a solution needs to be formulated that enhances the participation of the Somali women in peacebuilding and the achievement of the UNSCR 1325. In agricultural households, women feed livestock, collect water and firewood, take care of children and family members, and take care of farm animals. These circumstances reduce their participation in addressing social issues such as GBV and political participation to enact laws that prevent violence against women and girls. Increased incidences of inter-tribal wars in Somalia have led to many men taking up arms and abandoning their families who may consist of wives and female children. The absence of male member of the family has increased the exposure of many women to GBV. Women in rural areas of Somalia who participate in activities such as the collection of wood and water have been exposed to risks of GBV such as rape. Many women are subjected to female genital mutilation in Somalia. According to UNICEF report, approximately 90% of Somali women have undergone FGM. This practice is aimed at enhancing the honor of a girl and her family by enhancing her virginity until marriage. The practice is usually done forcefully in many cultural settings in Somalia. In rural settings, it is likely to be practiced using unclean razors or knives and sometimes under unhygienic conditions. This practice is one of the activities that threaten the achievement of WPS objectives. Women\'s active involvement in decision-making at the community level is crucial for sustainable peace. Recognizing the unique needs and vulnerabilities of women in conflict-affected areas, we must integrate gender perspectives into stabilization efforts, ensuring that women\'s rights are protected, and their voices are heard.\nPast WPS Initiatives in Somalia\nThe current situation in Somalia calls for the Women Peace and Security strategy to accurately reflect the prevailing conditions, particularly in the context of the ongoing war against Al Shabab. It is crucial for the strategy to address the specific challenges faced by women and girls, ensuring their rights are protected amidst the conflict. With stabilization efforts underway in areas liberated from Al Shabab control, the WPS strategy should emphasize the importance of empowering women to become agents of change and promoting comprehensive security during the early recovery, reconciliation, and development processes where women are part of the decision making in the communities. \nBy recognizing the unique needs and vulnerabilities of women in conflict-affected areas and integrating gender perspectives into stabilization and liberation efforts. Somalia can work towards a more inclusive and sustainable peace. The NAP prioritizes initiatives that promote women\'s participation in decision-making, enhance their access to justice and security, address gender-based violence, and provide support for women\'s economic empowerment and livelihood opportunities. \nBy doing so, Somalia can foster a more resilient society and contribute to lasting peace in the country. The Office of National Security has reviewed the existing National Action Plan (NAP) on Women\'s Peace and Security (WPS) and commended the efforts made thus far. While it serves as a great start, we recommend a thorough review of the NAP to ensure it accurately reflects the current situation in Somalia, particularly in light of the ongoing war against Al Shabab. It is imperative that the revised strategy addresses the specific challenges faced by women, children, and people with disabilities, with a focus on rebuilding trust and confidence in government security officials to provide safety and security for all. As stabilization efforts progress in areas liberated from Al Shabab control, the revised WPS- NAP should place emphasis on empowering women as agents of change and promoting equal opportunity during the early recovery, reconstruction, and development processes.\nThe FGS’s WPS strategy strives to fast-track the fulfillment of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution No. 1325(2021) by acknowledging the diverse security experiences of men, women, boys, and girls. This underscores the need for a security sector reform that is inherently sensitive to these varying experiences. With a keen focus on escalating women\'s roles within the security framework, particularly in decision-making capacities, the strategy aims to tackle the pivotal issue of gender-based violence in conflict zones. After a decade, it has become abundantly clear that a calculated and unified approach is vital for the comprehensive execution of the WPS agenda.\nIn sync with the United Nations Security Resolution 2607(2021) Benchmark 8, the Somali Government is committed to formulating a detailed and financially backed training plan. This initiative will encompass a "Train the Trainers" program to facilitate the effective rollout of the National Weapons and Ammunition Management. Significantly, the training plan will incorporate a gender-focused framework, potentially mandating female trainee quotas to secure their meaningful involvement.\nSomalia\'s Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Strategy aims to navigate the intricate web of challenges and opportunities peculiar to the country\'s socio-political climate. The linchpin of this strategy is the empowerment of Somali women as key stakeholders in peacebuilding, governance, and social reconstruction. Amidst a complex backdrop of ongoing conflict, tribal divisions, and extremist influences, this strategy lays out a path for women to play a transformative role in shaping a more peaceful, stable, and inclusive Somalia.\nThe long-term objective is to ensure that Somali women are not merely spectators but active participants in conflict prevention, peace negotiations, and governance. This includes facilitating their influence in traditional justice systems like "Xeer," and leveraging their roles in households and communities to create a culture of peace and social cohesion.\nThe government is aiming to scrutinize different elements affecting the empowerment of women\'s ability to engage in peace and security roles. This covers both past incidents and current governmental rules. The goal of the government is to provide strategic guidance on how to dismantle existing roadblocks and open up better opportunities for women to contribute to government roles, peacekeeping, and security tasks. The main objective is to craft a government strategy that aligns well with both national needs and international pledges, such as the Women, Peace, and Security laws and strategies passed by multiple nations within the region and around the world. To pave the way for this cultural and institutional shift, the WPS Strategy outlines three multifaceted objectives to achieve measurable progress by 2028:\nSkill Development and Inclusion: Implement targeted training programs to enhance women\'s capabilities in conflict resolution, negotiation, and leadership. Create platforms for mentorship and networking, connecting experienced women leaders with those aspiring to contribute to similar roles.\nSafety Nets and Accessibility: Guarantee that women and girls can securely and equitably access community-based support systems and governmental assistance to protect their safety, rights, and wellbeing before, during, and after conflicts without discrimination.\nSustainable Policy Infrastructure: Collaborate with local women’s groups and international human rights entities to develop policy frameworks that institutionalize women, peace, and security (WPS) initiatives, normalizing them through consistent funding, regulations, and integration across institutions to sustain programs long-term and enable widespread impact.\nDespite the above objectives, the government of Somalia has nit sufficiently addressed the issue of WPS due to lack of implementation plan, strategy, and procedures. There is insufficient community sensitization about the dangers of GBV against women and girls in Somalia and their little efforts have been made to address the community sensitization gaps. There is insufficient campaign at the grassroot level despite the opportunities it presents to address gender-based violence and peacebuilding. Another limitation of the current efforts is that there are insufficient legals measures to protect women from sexual harassment in Somalia. The legal framework is based on the Sharia Laws that supports patriarchy, limits decision-making privileges to women, and suppresses women empowerment. The issue of economic and social empowerment of women in Somalia has not been addressed satisfactorily with many women being poor and unable to play roles in peacekeeping missions such as political participation aimed at addressing violence and security issues. Fundings from donor agencies has not been sufficiently utilized to address the economic challenges encountered by women, making their participation in peacebuilding almost impossible to achieve. There is insufficient institutional capacity building to address the WPS goals and objectives. Lack of proactive human rights organizations in Somalia to advocate for prosecution of perpetrators of GBV has further led to limited success in gender mainstreaming towards the achievement of WPS objectives. \nChallenges and Barriers Encountered \nOne of the biggest hurdles to the effort is the extremist group Al-Shabaab which poses a severe risk to the country\'s safety. Their misinterpretation version of Sharia law limits women\'s freedom and roles in the country. The group uses sexual violence to terrorize people, and forces young girls into marriage. Different threats like clan conflicts, drought-induced insecurity, and domestic violence also hit men, women, and children in unique ways. Women, often lacking social status and resources, find it hard to seek justice after falling victim to violence. Cultural views and limited opportunities for education and work have also held back women\'s groups from the grassroots level. Tackling the complex mix of security risks, social issues, and financial inequality is crucial for the success of the WPS mission in Somalia.\nThe likelihood of reinforcing WPS agenda in Somalia is countered by the challenge of resistance to change due to the conservative nature of the society and government. The cultural environment is based on Sharia Laws that require women to be subordinate to men and not take part in major decision-making activities such as peacebuilding after armed conflicts. The conservative nature of the society further limits the effectiveness of women activism when their rights are violated. Therefore, any organization that aims to implement WPS initiatives in Somalia is likely to encounter such challenges as prohibition of women from participating in activism and political activities. There is also the problem of limited awareness of WPS among many government entities, NGOs, and civil rights organization, and communities about the importance of WPS, that further hampers its successful implementation. Somalia experiences many incidences of armed conflicts which increases insecurity to experts and professionals who may be interested in implementing WPS programs. The insecurity caused by armed conflicts reduces the ability to plan and implement WPS programs aimed at addressing GBV against women. Lack of knowledge of the elements of UNSCR 1325 among various stakeholders has limited their understanding of the effective strategy of rolling out the WPS programs in Somalia. To effectively roll out WPS strategies, there’s need for proof of what methods work, this data is often lacking. In some cases, there\'s a lack of political drive to fund focus, and implement WPS goals, leading to poor policy execution and underfunded initiatives. Most entities in Somalia lack empathy towards the predicament of women and girls and do not see the need for their involvement in conflicts resolution initiatives, peacebuilding, and reconstruction initiatives after armed conflicts. Lack of political will further leads to the allocation of fewer government resources to WPS programs such as training women to participate in peacebuilding and enhancement of security to protect women and girls from sexual violence during armed conflicts. The ongoing security challenges and the prevalence of armed groups in Somalia can create an environment of fear and intimidation, particularly for women. Ensuring the safety and protection of women who engage in peace and security efforts is crucial for their meaningful participation. There is also lack of collaboration between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and international agencies that address human rights such as the United Nations Security Council in formulation of an effective WPS program that addresses the issue of violence against women and their pack of participation in peacebuilding efforts. To resolve the above limitations, this paper provides a recommendation that describes the UNSCR 1325 strategies of achieving the goals of gender mainstreaming in peacebuilding that ensures the goal of preventing GBV in Somalia is achieved. \nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WPS STRATEGY\nEnhancement of Participation of Women in Peacebuilding Initiatives\nAccording to , the issue of WPS in Somalia can be best addressed by increasing the participation of women in peacebuilding process. This involves inclusion of women in decision-making committees during reconstruction programs after armed conflicts. Since women have better understanding of the challenges they encounter, it is likely that strategic peacebuilding solutions can be reached that ensure the issues of GBV and discrimination against women in Somalia are addressed. When armed conflicts occur between ethnic groups in Somalia, it is recommended that women participants need to be included in negotiating teams before ceasefire. Somali women also need to be included in the peacekeeping forces such as those involved in protection of IDPs in camps. Since women soldiers understand the challenges and vulnerabilities of their counterparts, they are likely to provide highly competent security services during peacekeeping missions. The legal framework needs to be bolstered to enhance the proportional representation of both male and female peacekeeping forces in areas affected by armed conflicts in Somalia. The effectiveness of participation in such programs is dependent on the extent to which they are provided with the relevant training and protected by legislation. There is the need to ensure legal framework are changed so that women are not prohibited from taking up firearms and contributing to peacebuilding programs. \nSomalia has committed itself to various global treaties centered around gender parity, including but not limited to CEDAW. Nevertheless, a chasm exists between these international pledges and their practical application. The reconciliation of global standards with local customs is undeniably challenging but imperative for a fortified legal environment supportive of women’s rights. Specific committees should be charged with assessing compliance with global guidelines and formulating policy advisories that resonate with the Somali ethos. This calls for a collective effort involving governmental agencies, local advocacy groups, and international entities. If Somalia is actively engaged with both internal legal adjustments and external global commitments, Somalia could set the course for a balanced, fair, and enduring infrastructure for empowering women across diverse arenas. This two-pronged strategy not only consolidates a resilient legal edifice but also synergizes with universal norms, positioning Somalia as a potential archetype for gender-inclusive legal transformation in regions grappling with conflict.\nWomen Participation in Protection of Victims of Armed Conflicts\nThis is a recommendation that women need to be included in the peacekeeping forces involved in protection of women and girls during armed conflicts such as those in refugee camps. The women who take part in such protection activities need to be provided with sufficient training on peacekeeping to be able to provide competent services in compliance with performance standards for security and peacekeeping in refugee camps where women and girls have been temporarily placed due to armed conflicts. Since many refugee camps have poorly designed housing structures, the settled women are at high risk of being sexually violated by intruders and male peacekeeping forces. The inclusion of women in the peacekeeping force at the refugee camps enable addressing gender-based security limitations caused by only deploying male forces. Somali women need to be involved in decision-making activities such as planning the establishment of refugee camps, planning the establishment of refugee camps for refugees in Somalia, and coordination of supplies and needs of women in IDP camps. The restrictive Sharia Laws need to be abolished to ensure women are not restricted to domestic roles such as caring for family members which has been the norm in Somalia. \nEnhanced Participation of Women in Relief and Recovery Programs\nThis is recommendation that the Somali government needs to increase women participation in undertaking relief and recovery programs after armed conflicts. Positions should be allocated for women to act as advisors, committee members, and counselors during the relief and recovery initiatives such as resettlement and repatriation of women and girls who had been previously displaced by armed conflicts. There should be gender balance in the composition of the taskforce involved in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to women and girls who have been displaced during armed conflicts. There should be enhanced collaboration among stakeholders such as governmental agencies, international organizations, civil society groups, and local leaders, in implementing gender-sensitive policies during relief and recovery after armed conflicts. These stakeholders collaborate to facilitate and oversee progressive changes in legislation, drive shifts in community attitudes, and contribute to the pursuit of a more equal opportunity that empowers women to participate in repatriation, rehabilitation, and resettlement of women and girls.  While NGOs often provide crucial support to governmental initiatives, especially in areas affected by conflict, it is essential to emphasize a shift towards a model where key stakeholders support, rather than dictate to, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS). This approach centers on Somali-led ownership, ensuring that FGS plans receive the necessary backing and fostering a sustainable path forward. Additionally, local tribal authorities, who hold significant influence over large segments of the community, must be engaged thoughtfully. Their engagement can ensure many norms that perpetuate gender inequities are abolished and an enabling environment is created that enables women to be participants in peacebuilding activities focusing on recovery after armed conflicts.\nCommunity Awareness Programs \nThe objective of this strategy is to change the community perception regarding the role of women in peacebuilding and the state of discrimination against women when addressing armed conflict issues. Despite increasing recognition of the critical role that women can play in community-based conflict resolution and peacebuilding, their participation remains stunted due to sociocultural miss norms and systemic gender biases. Therefore, community awareness programs are important in changing the way stakeholders perceive women participation in peacebuilding initiatives in Somalia. Legislative agencies such as the Somali parliament needs to be informed about the relevance of women participation in peacebuilding, relief, and recovery so that they can enact less restrictive legislations. Members of the community such as families, religious entities, and local leaders need to be engaged in awareness programs in which they are educated about the benefits of women participation in peacebuilding. Awareness needs to further focus on the benefits of multifaceted approach to peacebuilding when women are involved. \nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN\nImplementation Plan for of Participation of Women in Peacebuilding Initiatives\nThe following are set of activities to be carried out to successfully ensure women participation in peacebuilding initiatives in Somalia. \nTargets: Increase the number of women recruited into peacebuilding programs, increase in women policymakers for peacekeeping initiatives in Somalia, increase in women security advisors in Somalia. \nIndicators: Decrease in the cases of GBV, high stabilization index, increase in the percentage of women peacekeepers, an increase in women parliamentarians and civil society organizations. \nCoordinating Meetings (the First 1 month)\nIn the first month, it is suggested that there should be meetings between FGS representatives and armed conflicts management entities such as the ONS, The Ministry of Internal Security, and National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA). This meeting should involve formulation of a strategy for deployment of peacekeeping forces to areas affected by armed conflicts. \nAdvisory Sessions with Security Sector Bodies (1.5 months)\nDuring This session, stakeholders will meet with advisory entities on humanitarian crisis and formulate a plan and budget for responding to armed conflicts. The advisory information obtained will be used to determine the number of women participants in the peacebuilding efforts. \nSelection of Women (1/2 months)\nPositions for women participants in the peacebuilding initiatives will be advertised and women will be selected on competitive basis. \nTraining of Women (2month)\nThis session will involve providing training to women who have been selected to take part in various positions as peacekeepers such as peacekeeping forces, advisors, and members of peacekeeping committees. \nDeployment of Women Participants in Peacebuilding (11 months)\nThis stage will involve deployment of women to various positions such as peacekeepers in IDP camps, advisors in peacekeeping committees, and peacekeepers at regions commonly attacked by armed militias. \nImplementation Plan for Women Participation in Protection of Victims of Armed Conflicts\nTargets: To increase the number of women personnel involved in investigation of armed groups and disarmament of groups that pose threats to women and girls and reduce GBV among displaced women and girls.\nIndicators: Reduced cases of GBV among the IDP women and girls, and an increase in the number of women participants in the prevention of occurrence of armed conflicts. \nMeetings with Stakeholders (1 month)\nMeetings will be held between the government entities such as the ONS, NISA, the Ministry of Internal Security, and local leadership to identify IDP women and girls at risk of GBV. \nSituational Analysis (2months)\nAthis will involve an analysis of the state of security, the likelihood of occurrence of armed conflicts, the likely magnitude of the conflict, and the people at risk. \nSelection of Women Participants (0.5 months)\nWomen will be selected to be part of the peacekeeping forces in regions likely to experience armed conflicts and IDP camps at risk of being attacked by armed groups. \nTraining (2 month)\nWomen who have been selected to be part of the peacekeeping forces will be trained to acquire skills in providing protection to IDP women and girls, political advisors to the government, and peacebuilding committee roles. \nDeployment to Protection Initiatives (8 months)\nWomen will be deployed in areas likely to experience armed conflicts to provide protection security services alongside male peacebuilding security forces. Women will also be deployed to identify perpetrators of sexual violence and aiding in their prosecution. \nImplementation Plan for Involvement of Women in Relief and Recovery Programs\nTargets: Increase the number of women participants in relief and recovery programs after armed conflicts, increase resettlement of victims of armed conflicts, safety of women and girls during resettlement. \nIndicators: A high number of women political advisors in relief efforts, involvement of women in supply of relief supplies to victims of armed conflicts, reduced cases of GBV during resettlement of victims of armed conflict. \nMeetings with Armed Conflicts Management Entities (1 month)\nMeetings will be held among armed conflicts management entities such as Somalia’s Ministry of Internal Security, NISA, ONS, NGOs, and civil rights groups to formulate a framework for relief and recovery after armed conflicts in Somalia. \nFormulation of Relief and Recovery Plan (1.5 months)\nThe committee will formulate a recovery and relief plan for armed conflicts focusing on resettlement, rehabilitation, and repatriation of IDP women and girls. The plan will aim at increasing the number of women personnel in the relief and recovery activities while also accounting for the safety of the victims from GBV. \nSelection of Women Participants (1 month)\nWomen will be selected from the civilian population depending on their personal skills, individual characteristics, and motivation to participate in the recovery and relief programs. Positions to be filled by women during the recruitment include: advisory members, relief supplies managers, and relief committee members. \nTraining and Induction (1 month)\nAfter the required number of women are selected, they will be trained to acquire knowledge and skills of collaboration with other relief and recovery team members, how to cope with difficulties during relief programs, and safety measures to take to protect IDP women and girls from GBV. \nDeployment (12 months)\nWomen will be deployed to areas in Somalia that are affected by armed conflicts to provide relief and recovery services. The estimated duration of the recovery and relief initiatives is estimated to be 2 months. During this period, women will contribute towards advising the relief teams regarding the needs of IDPs during resettlement and formulation of security solutions that reduce the risk of GBV against women and girls. They will also act as agents of relief services providers. \nImplementation Plan for Community Awareness Programs \nTargets: To increase community awareness about the relevance of women participation in peacebuilding during and after armed conflicts in Somalia.\nIndicators: Reduced discrimination against women during deployment of peacekeeping forces to conflict areas, reduced gender discrimination in appointment to peacebuilding committees, participation of women in advisory roles on how to address armed conflict and reduce GBV. \nMeeting With Stakeholders (2 months)\nThis 2-month program will involve meetings by the stakeholders in peacebuilding such as the ONS, NISA, FGS, NGOs, and Civil rights organizations to formulate awareness creation, objectives, and goals that increase community acceptance of women to participate in peacebuilding. \nIdentification of Awareness Gap and Formulation of Awareness Program (3 months)\nThe implementation taskforce will identify the gaps in gender equality in the society that inhibit Somali women from participating in peacebuilding programs. Gaps include cultural beliefs, norms, religious beliefs that inspire discrimination against Somali women during participation in peacebuilding initiatives. Data will be collected from government agencies, NGOs, religious organizations, and households regarding their perception of the roles of women in the society and peacebuilding. \nImplementation of Awareness Program (6 months)\nThe awareness program will be formulated lasting 6 months. The team involved in implementing the program will consist of both men and women, representatives from government entities, representatives of NGOs, and civil society organizations. The awareness program will involve educating the public about the benefits of supporting women’s participation in peacebuilding and efforts to address GBV in Somalia. The program will be concluded when all the stakeholders have been reached. \nExpected Outcomes of the strategy \nIt is expected that after the program, there will be a high number of women participants in peacebuilding initiatives in Somalia in such areas as peacekeeping forces, peacekeeping advisory committees, women participants in WPS policy formulation, women leaders of civil rights organizations that address the issues of sexual and gender-based violence in Somalia, and participation of women in future peacekeeping missions in Somalia. It is also expected that insecurity and cases of GBV will reduce because of the strategic and relevant input from women participants in WPS programs during armed conflicts. Overall, it is expected that the well-being of women and girls will be addressed through gender mainstreaming of peacekeeping missions because women participation in peacekeeping will lead to the identification of vulnerabilities experienced by women, their basic needs, and ensure peacekeeping strategies are effectively formulated to reduce insecurity, promote peace in Somalia, and prevent GBV. The following is a summarized list of performance indicators for the success of the WPS program in Somalia. \nGovernance Metrics:\nAchieve a significant quota for female representation within the security and local persecutor’s, parliamentary seats, and other decision-making bodies by 2025.\nReduce the legislative and administrative barriers to women’s political participation by 30% in 2025 in the aspect of participation in peacebuilding initiatives.\nIncrease the number of active females within the peacekeeping force and within the security Agency to 50% by 2025 .\nSocial Metrics:\nDecrease reported cases of gender-based violence by 40% by 2025, using 2021 numbers as a baseline.\nReduce cases of IDPs of women during armed conflicts by 40% by by 2025.\nIncorporated within these targets are qualitative indicators, including:\nAn improvement in public opinion towards equal opportunities in peacebuilding activities, aiming for a 30% more favourable view as gauged by biennial surveys.\nMedia analyses showing aat least 25% increase in positive narratives surrounding women\'s roles peacebuilding activities in Somalia.\nThe data for these indicators will be collected through a variety of methods including surveys, official records, and third-party reports, and will be subject to rigorous validation. Regular updates and recalibrations will be performed to ensure alignment with the evolving context and needs of Somali women.\nCONCLUSION\nThe objective of this report was to formulate a gender perspective in achieving the UNSCR 1325 peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. The advantage of gender perspective in peacebuilding strategy is that it ensures sufficient gender balance and reduces the severity of discrimination against women. Somalia is a case where GBV has been common due to many cases of armed conflicts. Many women and girls have been subjected to various forms of GBV such as rape, sexual harassment, psychological violence, domestic violence, among others. The suggestion of women participation in peacebuilding provides a foundation for resolving the issue of sexual violence against women in Somalia and enhancement of their integration into the social, political, and economic processes that enhance the protection of their rights. Gender balance in the composition of committees involved in formulating peacebuilding strategy is significant in incorporating the opinions of women that can be critical during post-conflict reconstruction programs in Somalia. This paper also emphasis gender balance in the composition of agencies involved in addressing armed conflicts such as ONS, the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Protection, the NISA, and the Ministry of Internal Security of Somalia', 'The Dreyfus Affair: A Reflection of European National Attitudes and Anti-Semitism in the Late Nineteenth Century The Dreyfus Affair, which erupted in France in the late 19th century, serves as a seminal event illuminating the complex interplay of nationalism and anti-Semitism in European society. At its core, the affair revolved around the wrongful conviction of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French Army, for treason—a charge based on fabricated evidence and fueled by rampant anti-Semitic sentiment. Through an examination of the socio-political context surrounding the affair, the reactions it provoked, and its lasting implications for European national attitudes, this essay argues that the Dreyfus Affair not only exposed the deep-seated anti-Semitism within French society but also highlighted the broader struggles of identity and nationalism in late 19th-century Europe. The Dreyfus Affair began in 1894 when Dreyfus was accused of leaking military secrets to Germany. The trial was marked by a lack of concrete evidence, yet Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil’s Island. Scholars such as Ruth Halperin-Kaddari argue that the trial was not merely a legal proceeding but a reflection of prevailing societal attitudes toward Jews, who were often seen as outsiders within the national community (Halperin-Kaddari 223). This sentiment was exacerbated by the context of French nationalism, which was increasingly defined in ethnic and religious terms. The rise of nationalist movements in Europe, particularly in France, made the Dreyfus Affair a flashpoint for debates about identity and belonging. The reaction to the Dreyfus Affair was polarized, revealing the deep divisions within French society. Prominent figures such as Émile Zola spoke out against the injustice, famously declaring, “J’accuse!” in an open letter that criticized the military and judicial system (Zola 45). This bold stance galvanized public opinion and sparked widespread protests, drawing attention to the underlying anti-Semitism that permeated the case. Zola’s intervention exemplified how the affair transcended the confines of the courtroom, evolving into a broader struggle for justice and civil rights. As historian Michael Marrus notes, “the Dreyfus Affair exposed the fragility of the French Republic’s ideals, particularly in regards to liberty, equality, and fraternity” (Marrus 112). The affair also had significant repercussions beyond France, influencing attitudes toward Jews across Europe. It served as a catalyst for the Zionist movement, as many Jews began to recognize the need for a national homeland in response to entrenched anti-Semitism. Theodor Herzl, a key figure in this movement, argued that the Dreyfus Affair demonstrated that Jews would never be fully accepted in European societies, spurring the call for a Jewish state (Herzl 78). This shift in perception highlighted the intersection of nationalism and anti-Semitism, suggesting that the Dreyfus Affair was emblematic of broader European trends that marginalized minority groups. In conclusion, the Dreyfus Affair reveals the complex relationship between nationalism and anti-Semitism in late 19th-century Europe. It not only exposed the deep-seated prejudices within French society but also had lasting implications for Jewish identity and political movements across the continent. By examining the affair, we gain critical insights into the struggles over national identity and the systemic discrimination faced by minorities, themes that resonate in contemporary discussions about nationalism and civil rights. The Dreyfus Affair remains a powerful reminder of the dangers of prejudice and the importance of justice, equality, and the recognition of diverse identities within a nation.', "The role of leadership is extensive and requires skill to affect organizational culture, improve performance, and guarantee the accomplishment of objectives. Leadership styles have become more complex over time due to numerous theories that advance the effectiveness of leadership. This study examines and evaluates the prevailing leadership styles, authoritarian, bureaucratic, and laissez-faire while exploring the difference between managers and leaders.\nTypes of Leadership Models\nAn autocratic leadership style is characterized by complete individual control over all decisions, with little or no team member engagement. Autocratic leaders seldom seek advice from their subordinates, instead making choices based solely on their thoughts and judgments. According to Finkelman (2019), this strategy works effectively when working with beginner teams that may need to be fully aware of their duties or when making quick judgments is critical, such as in a crisis. However, because it limits team members' participation in decision-making, it may decrease employee satisfaction and creativity. \nOn the other hand, bureaucratic leaders adopt strict standards and procedures while overseeing organizations and enterprises. This strategy requires executives to closely follow the company's rules, regulations, and hierarchy. This method works effectively in regulated departments or businesses, such as banking, healthcare, and government institutions, where adhering to rules and laws is critical. According to Finkelman (2017), although it ensures consistency and respect for standards, it can be inflexible, inhibiting innovation and delaying decision-making in situations that require flexibility. \nLastly, a laissez-faire leadership style allows team members to reach conclusions and solve problems. Leaders foster an environment of trust and independence by providing necessary resources and tools without micromanaging. This technique is effective in creative sectors or with highly skilled, experienced teams that can work independently to achieve goals. However, if it is not implemented with defined objectives and regular feedback, it may result in a lack of direction and coordination.\nDifference between Leaders and Managers\nWhile both are imperatives for an organization's survival, managers and leaders have different positions and working methods. Leadership is the ability of a person to see and have a clear blueprint of where an organization should be. A leader inspires, encourages, and guides their followers to that destination. They are good at positioning strategic goals, encouraging teammates to commit to change and innovation, and being comfortable with the overall picture. Leading focuses more on people, relationships, and emotional intelligence when setting a vision and moving people toward it. However, managers are expected to implement the mandates formulated by the leaders. The management of the processes involves stipulating objectives, designing master plans, allocating resources, and making sure that work is completed on time under the available budget. Managers pay attention to collecting tools, methods, and procedures for well-organized working arrangements. The significant difference between a manager and a leader is that a manager mainly deals with controlling and maintaining the day-to-day operations, which are short-term goals that emphasize control, organization, and order. On the other hand, leaders motivate and instead drive change by focusing on the long-term vision and the people's empowerment (Kakemam et al., 2020). Both management and leadership are essential; management is directed to fulfill and realize a mission via proper planning and execution, whereas leadership serves as guidance and inspiration.\nAn Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Leadership Styles\nAutocratic leadership works well in a situation where quick response and specific instructions are needed, such as examples of crisis management and easy routine work. Its decisiveness can ensure uniformity in execution and speed up operations. Its inefficiency, however, derives from potential decreases in team creativity and enthusiasm since it may discourage individual initiative and restrict opportunities for employees to grow as leaders (Caillier, 2020). This method may result in significant employee turnover and dissatisfaction over time, especially in dynamic environments that need innovation and agility. \nBureaucratic leadership is beneficial in highly regulated industries or jobs because it ensures efficiency via respect to laws and established processes. This paradigm shows a controlled and predictable environment by mitigating risks and assuring compliance (O’Reilly & Chatman, 2020). However, the cause for its inefficiency is its rigidity and slowness in adjusting to change. It can stifle creativity and adaptability by prioritizing restrictions over invention, making it less helpful in industries that require rapid innovation and flexibility to meet changing customer expectations.  \nOn the other hand, Laissez-faire Leadership allows things to occur spontaneously. Leading highly competent, self-sufficient teams is where the leadership excels in efficiency, particularly in creative or knowledge-based enterprises. Besides, it empowers people to take the initiative and own their jobs, fostering innovation and quick change adaptation (Jin & Men, 2023). However, its inefficiency may be apparent without clear instructions and frequent feedback, resulting in misunderstandings, a lack of collaboration, and inconsistent performance. This paradigm requires a balance of autonomy and oversight to ensure that strategic goals are met and innovation is promoted. \nAs a result, the organizational context, team composition, and specific objectives all influence how successful a particular leadership paradigm is. Laissez-faire leadership promotes autonomy but may lack coherence without oversight; authoritarian leadership provides clear direction but may inhibit creativity; and bureaucratic leadership ensures conformity but may stifle innovation (Jin & Men, 2023). Successful leaders routinely adapt their approach to meet the needs and goals of their team, using elements from each model to improve productivity and effectiveness.\nPersonal Experience\nIn my nursing practice within my local healthcare center, the leader who most significantly influenced me for the better exemplified transformational leadership. Excellent patient care and high team morale were the outcomes of this leader's endorsement, support, and promotion of professional development, as well as their unambiguous vision. Conversely, the minimum level of influence was perceived under the guidance of a transactional leader, whose sole focus was on imminent objectives and tasks, thereby diminishing team morale. Therefore, the most effective leadership style is transformational because it cultivates an atmosphere characterized by empowerment and ongoing progress. Consistent with my experience, Hilton et al. (2021) discovered that transformative leadership in healthcare contexts substantially enhances patient outcomes and job satisfaction.\nIn summary, this study on leadership styles reveals that there is yet to be a universally applicable strategy for effective leadership. The organization's specific circumstances, objectives, and team dynamics should all be taken into account when choosing a leadership style. The leadership style adjustment improves project outcomes by increasing innovation, ownership, and team morale.", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterature Review \nThis chapter critically analyses the relevant literature, focusing on how best practices and preserving knowledge for the future can influence the management of formula student events. Two research objectives guide the review, determining the best practices for managing of formula student events from the team perspective and how knowledge can be effectively preserved for the future. This section outlines the frameworks and theories suitable to the current research, especially sports management frameworks, like Sports Logistics Framework and Sport Logistics Triangle, and management theories categorized into themes like leadership and marketing. It also highlights gaps in reviewed studies that the current study will address.\n\nSports Management Frameworks\nHerold et al. (2019) developed the Sport Logistics Framework based on a systematic literature review in order to provide guidance to the investigation of sports logistics in sport organisations, especially for events and gameday operations. (See Figure 1). By providing this conceptual framework for sports logistics, the writers aim to inform the sector on relevant strategic and operational levels of logistics management and set the stage for other empirical studies that could advance sport logistics planning and management (Herold et al., 2019). \nFigure 1: Sport Logistics Framework \nSource: Herold et al. (2019)\nThe figure above shows three types of sports events. As illustrated in Figure 2 below, the framework inspires the current study to suggest a theoretical framework that lays the foundation of analyzing the infrastructure, location, staff, audience, size, and time of for formula student sports events in the UK. Hence, although the framework is based on a single case study, limiting its generalizability, theoretically, it informs this investigation’s understanding of sports logistics in various management areas, primarily formula student sports venue, sports equipment, athletes, and fan and spectators logistics management.\nFigure 2: Sports Logistic Pillars\nSource: Herold et al. (2019)\nPott et al. (2023) also used a literature review to propose a theoretical framework called the Sport Logistics Triangle. The triangle anchors its approach to logistics management, especially sports logistics management, on various academic disciplines. As shown in Figure 3, sports logistics entail three aspects: the sports sector, which encompasses professional, nonprofit, and public institutions; flow type, involving material, people, and information; and the network perspective, which entails intralogistics, transportation, and supply chain. This approach is substantial since it allows for classifying of sport logistics activities. It is relevant to the current study. Its insights will inform the present study’s theoretical understanding of logistics/events management. Inspired by this theoretical approach, the current research will focus on organising and optimising formula student logistics processes within the sports industry. Its systematic classification of sports logistics activities can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of logistical operations in formula student sports organisations. Further, it boosts the current framework by integrating logistics management principles with formula student management practices, appreciating a comprehensive perspective on managing logistics in the sports sector and emphasising the importance of clarity and quality in executing formula student sport logistical tasks. \n\nFigure 3: Sport Logistics Triangle\nSource: Pott et al. (2023)\nTaks et al. (2017) present an Event Leveraging Framework to examine the processes and challenges involved in leveraging sports events to build sport participation. As shown in Figure 4, this framework emphasises planning, implementation, and outcomes in a sport event. Even though this approach overlooks critical factors like uncertain political and economic stability, cost of sports events, and pollution, it inspires the current investigation to emphasise strategic planning and execution of formula student sports events, guaranteeing success and supporting for increased formula student sports participation. \n\n\nFigure 4: Event Leveraging Framework\nSource: Taks et al. (2017)\nThe application of these theoretical approaches in the matter outlined above align with the current sport management research focusing on theoretical and methodological approaches to studying community. A study by Rich et al. (2021) supports the development of a framework for teaching sport-event management within a community context. Presenting a detailed perspective on community, the author associated such a framework to context, outcome, site for struggle, and regulation or social control. Inspired by Nufer (2002), the current study will establish an image transfer model in sports event marketing and sponsoring, laying the foundation for understanding the impact of formula student sport events on brand perception and sponsorship. By recognising the role of formula student sports events in shaping brand perceptions, the current research will underscore the importance of strategic formula student event management in enhancing organisational image and sponsor relationships.\n\nDeGaris (2010) explores the translation of motorsports sponsorship features into sponsor benefits through the utilisation of a benefits grid.

Understanding the fundamental elements of sports marketing activities for sports events is essential for creating memorable and immersive experiences that resonate with supporters and contribute to the overall growth and sustainability of sports events.\nPlanning\nMuskat and Deery (2017) explores knowledge transfer and organisational memory within the context of events. The research demonstrates that explicit knowledge is primarily shared before events, while tacit knowledge exchange mainly occurs during event operations. This distinction highlights the significance of comprehending the transfer and utilisation of different knowledge forms in event management settings. By examining the interplay between explicit and tacit knowledge transfer, the authors contribute to the optimization of knowledge management practices within the events industry. This is interesting when compared with Taylor and Edmondson (2007), who emphasise the importance of planning for legacy in major sporting events to maximise impact. It details the necessity of having a well-defined legacy vision that outlines the benefits expected to endure long after the event has concluded. Understanding this proactive approach to legacy planning is crucial for ensuring that the event's outcomes contribute positively to the community, economy, and infrastructure in the long term. Taylor and Edmondson (2007) believe that legacy planning involves strategic foresight and a comprehensive understanding of how the event can catalyse lasting benefits for various stakeholders. By establishing a clear and robust legacy vision early in the planning process, event organisers can align their efforts towards generating sustainable impacts that extend far beyond the event itself. Furthermore, the emphasis on legacy planning in major events underscores the need for organisers to adopt a holistic perspective that considers not only the immediate outcomes of the event but also its enduring effects. When integrating legacy considerations into the event planning framework, stakeholders can proactively design initiatives that capitalise on the event's momentum to drive long-lasting social, economic, and environmental benefits. Maylor et al. (2008) explored managerial complexity within project-based operations, presenting a grounded model with practical implications. The analysis focuses on knowledge management to provide authentic insights into understanding and describing managerial complexity in project environments. By aligning the conceptualization of managerial complexity with real project settings, the authors show the significance of practical frameworks in project management. This research contributes to improving knowledge management practices and effectively addressing the intricacies of managing complex projects. \n\nVolunteer\nKersulić et al.

The nature of the Yorkshire moors\' weather, seasons, and physical landscape mirrors social isolation, wildness, freedom, and passion.\n\tThe moors area is the novel\'s physical setting and a metaphorical situational representation of the two major characters. The novel\'s landscape, seasons, and weather are wild, representing turbulent relationships and emotions, especially of Heathcliff and Catherine. The description of landscape, weather, and seasons sets forth the nature of the two characters. Moors\' turbulent nature shows the rugged nature of Heathcliff and Cathy. They have a passion for roaming the untamed and ragged landscape. The nature of the characters is set forth when Bronte describes the state of the house station. She says, "Happily, the architect had the foresight to build it strong (Vine 339). Also, the novel’s mood and atmosphere are set forth by the following statement. It says, “‘Wuthering’ being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather” (Brontë 4). The untamed landscapes of the moors mirror the turmoil in relationships and emotions—the weather is harsh and unpredictable, reflecting the nature of the characters\' relationships and emotional state. For instance, after Cathy dies, a storm occurs outside, showing the intense emotional state of the characters. \n\tThe moors and their state play a crucial role in developing the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine. There is a strong connection between physical landscape, weather, and seasons to the two characters. Despite the harsh weather in the moors, the house station does not bow down to pressure. According to the article by Vine, the house is under stress but showing stability with its windows sunk, desperately and defensively (Vince 339). The stability of the house station, despite string wind and storms, represents the undying passion of Heathcliff and Cathy, who yearn for freedom and isolation in the moors away from the confinement of their communities. Heathcliff is closely associated with the moors as he spends most of his time, and they amplify his senses, showing strong attraction. The remoteness and ruggedness of moors reflect the character\'s inability to fit into a more significant social life. The moors need better transport, which means connecting with other parts, implying the characters do not have any social connection to the people outside the moors. Heathcliff feels he is a foreigner and exiled and does not integrate into the culture and social life of the larger communities. The moors provide him with solace as he roams in search of belonging. Since Heathcliff and Catherine have grown away from civilized communities, they need more social norms to maintain their unity.\n\tIn general, moors symbolize isolation and desolation. The moors are between Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, where the two main characters roam without inhibitions. From the perspective of Heathcliff and Cathy, they symbolize freedom from social barriers and religion. Despite the danger and menace present in the moors, they offer solace to the two.\n\tIn conclusion, Bronte uses moors metaphorically to reflect Heathcliff\'s and Cathy\'s state. Just like the moors, which are isolated and desolated, the two characters are socially alienated from the larger social body away from the moors. The moors’ physical landscape, weather, and seasons are used to mirror emotions and relationship turbulences. They also set the novel\'s theme, es, mood, and atmosphere, driving its didactic nature.', 'The project untangles the complicated weave of U.S. Black Masculinity, Black Queerness and Black Theology virtually intertwined with each other in ones social identity to begin the exploration of modern African American literary works. As seen through the prism of literature, the research paper examines stories that arguments– depicting various African American individuals confronted with the complexity of identities. The introductory section provides a summary of the general subject and main themes to be covered, such as Black queer identity and the social injustices these demographics experience. The literature on black queer is constantly changing, with recent focuses on race, gender identities, or sexual orientation. This section delves into the historical backgrounds of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community and particularities related to Black queer people, including violence and online hate. Black queers are individuals who identify with black race as well as the LGBTQ+ community. The word queer perfectly encompasses the intersectional experiences and fluid identities that make people who they are.  These individuals are considered queer because their sexual orientations and gender identities fall under the LGBTQ+ community. Nevertheless, the identities that categorize someone as queer are affected by bi-erasure, homophobia, and racism. As a result, most people are struggling with identity development or formation. Such individuals are afraid to declare their sexual orientation because of the prevalent social injustice that they are exposed to. Being black and queer transcends culture, religion, life experience, and socio-economic status. Thus, there is a need to engage in identity debates that discuss the need to be sensitive and respectful to these individuals. A historical look at the development of Black queer literature reveals that during the early to mid-20th century, there were limited publications on blacks or black queer individuals because the prevailing societal conditions prohibited it. The 1990s and the first few decades of the new millennium became impressively studded with the literature on Black queer experiences. The 21st century has witnessed a surge in anthologies, and academic interest in Black Queer Literary Studies increased some more, which brought richness to the portrait of black queer experiences.  This conversation around the process of identity formation shows us that race, religion, gender identity, and sexual orientation are key links where their intersections not only present challenges but also opportunities. That identity is influenced by family and culture; the idea of negotiating between personal identity and cultural or familial expectations becomes paramount. In tracing the extended religious crisis of James Baldwin, the researcher pays attention to its relation with puritanical forces that represent black people and sexuality in terms of abject. This is how the author addresses Puritanism as a mode of luring Baldwin into black religion and church, which he identifies with an attempt to bring back moral authority over blacks via blues language or looks at semiotic implications inherent in puritys blue bodies that are shut out from prevalent liberation narratives based on pious doctrines dismissing feminine and masculine. This study suggests that the rigid feature of Christianity poses problems for black liberation theology, which is essentially exodic masculine in its nature. In this case the shift from the exodus narrative to exile is highlighted; thus, Baldwins impact on black religion and theology as conversion bars disrupts. Finally, the chapter wraps up by concluding a brave queer idea of salvation and suggesting so-called blues Christology which comes out after Baldwins death . The controversy begins when individuals are expected to self-discover themselves within the confines that society imposes. Even so, it requires a supportive environment devoid of stereotypes and stigma. In most cases, the process of identity integration is suggested as resistance to societal attempts at making people fit into strict categories because to rise and identify as black and queer requires challenging societal norms. These themes show how people, through their unique identities, help bring about more significant social change and defy oppressive norms. As the passage concludes, it also addresses what social injustices are found within the LGBTQ+ community and that discrimination is an act of harm toward dignity. It identifies particular issues facing the LGBTQ+ community, such as violent attacks, hate speech online, and compromised confidentiality. Considering the debatable points above, this study will attempt to answer how the intersection of sexual orientation and race contributes to the identity development of black queer individuals and the role that social injustice plays in shaping their experiences. The following section includes the outline for the literature review, detailing acts of injustice against Black queer people and interventions to safeguard their rights. This research paper aims at focusing on the race, religion, sexuality and identity in Black Queer Literary Studies pertaining to African American gay individuals. Through analyzing the role of family life, cultural beliefs and social prejudices that contribute to identity formation and challenges in Black queer population, this study attempts to demystify internal functioning processes inherent within their community. The central question that propels this exploration is: What are the intricate intersections of family, culture and society that construct identity development for African American gay men and what is their significance in terms of how they live their lives and potential well-being outcomes? This study seeks to make a significant contribution to better understand the accounts that arise from the intersection of U.S Black Masculinity, Black Queerness and Black Theology through an insight analysis into African American literature Summary and synthesis History of Black Queer Literature Numerous studies have examined the history of sexuality but few have inter-examined sexuality in a dialectic and dialogic manner as observed in Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology. The author traces a political view of the racism directed against gay men rather than provide a socialist view. In the discourse, sociologist Steven Epsteins chronology lists Foucaults History of Sexuality: Volume 1 ahead of all studies on sexuality. However, the sociologist view attempts to explain sexual practices in a social dimension rather than in a biological dimension. Moreover, the study recounts the developments brought about by black diaspora literature. James Baldwin is a predominant figure in these publications who conceptualized a slogan no name in the street to protest political motives against queer individuals. Over the years, queer theory and epistemology became academic disciplines and were joined together in philosophical concepts. Following, the unction of queer films constructed a new identify outside the usual binary categories . Regarding religion, black spirituality is considered the earliest in African-American religious conversation. Earliest developments of African religion were perpetuated by various authors including but not limited to W. E. B. DuBois and Zora Neale Hurston. The underlying theme in both written and oral literature was the role of culture. Matthews analysis reveals the concerns of Africans for a political, religious, and psychological identity . Foster, describes the evolution of Black queer studies in conjunction with Queer Studies and African American literature. He starts by criticizing some scholars in Queer Studies for their limited view focused on the experiences of gay white men and demonstrating how such narrow focus erased Black voices. The critics addressed such as Emmanuel Nelson and James Dievler, together with William Cohen are criticized for simplification of Baldwins sexuality and race exploration. The critique highlights the shortcomings of their assessments and inability to consider multilayered dichotomies that are inherent in Baldwins literature. The study then turns to current researchers who practice academic language at the intersection of African American and homosexual discourses . Bryan Washingtons criticism provides a beginning, interrogating the racial protocol of what he calls white gay theory. This passage makes mention scholars such as Kendall Thomas and Marlon Ross as well as Robert Reid-Pharr who operate consciously on this crossroads between race and sexuality. Kendall Thomas for example is portrayed to turn the routine homophobia within African American literary criticism of Baldwins work upside down. Marlon Ross expands this critique, charging black intellectuals with their aversion to harmonizing Baldwins sexual concerns and its racial issues. In his book Black Gay Man: Reid-Pharr overtly describes the inclinations of a number of scholars in both black queer studies and ordinary Queer Studies to avoid such fundamental issues as subjectivity, especially when it comes to cross-racial desire. Reid-Pharrs view in the narrative is her analysis of Baldwins Another Country. Baldwin saw a pattern among liberal white Americans of an unwillingness to discuss race in connection with their sexuality. As Reid-Pharr observes, this silence reaffirms the culture of white supremacy by hiding whiteness and over picturing blackness. Reid-Pharr argues that it is imperative to break this silence and openly speak about race in the site of sexual relations as one way of contesting these hardened ideological processes. On the other hand, the development of Black queer literature, as explored by Alvin J. Henry in Black Queer Flesh: Rejecting Subjectivity in the African American Novel, explores various intricacies of personal identity, collective expectations, and subjective rejection driven by African Americans literature. The study starts by pointing out the permeable border of self and group, highlighting difficulties related to attempts on part individuals would make in order maintain personal desires and ideologies within larger societal entities. In Henry, the bildungsroman is analyzed as a problematic narrative form for its tendency to ignore community struggles occurring beyond those that are white middle-class. This story almost always requires the suppression of aspects of identity which can be deemed problematic by the governing norms . Even so, Ferguson traces the development of racial statements against black men from 1938. Through his study, racial disintegrations are embedded in sociology. That photo taken in 1938 has evolved to become the epitome of all sociology studies related to races. Moreover, the study integrates sexuality with racial inclusion where the author categorizes racial actions against black men as actions intended to keep white women pure . Identity formation The section will discuss the arguments of sources and link them in terms of connections, school of thought, and recommendations for study. In the study of building an identity among African Americans, family interactions and upbringing based on gender roles have a considerable effect. Despite experiencing social injustice of marginalization, identity formation is considered a resilient strategy for overcoming the complexities of intersecting social identities.  Additionally, more emphasis is laid on the correlation between race and sexual identity development for Black gay men. The study reveals a pleasant reciprocal process, meaning racial identity plays a more significant role in gay identity.  Moreover, the major themes fronted by this researcher include homophobia and black self-hate, which he says are the unique battles that Black queer people go through. Conflict that hampers identity formation among African American gay men is cultural perceptions. There is an inherent cultural perception of individual identities, so when African American gay men attempt to defy this identity, controversies buildup.  The research traces the history of queer identity in pushing out heteronormative ideals from society and embracing more representative models inspired by transgender folks, people of color, and others with intersecting identities who experience all sorts of varied life experiences. Moreover, the intersectional perspectives suggested an investigation of LGBTQ identity formation among the older and younger generations in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The study further looks into the implications of gentrification and evolving social sanction by pointing out race, class, and generation in forming identities. Moreover, the study reveals gaps among races, sexual orientations, and gender disparities in addition to advocating for further research that will link development stages with identity health as well as stress. Using intersectionality theories and ecological systems theory supports the concept that teenager identity should be understood from different lenses.  The study focuses on how systematic inequality, interrelated systems of oppression, and power dynamics impact various socialization contexts. Moreover, social change has an impact on sexual minority people. Social change can trigger changes in attitude and acceptance levels towards sexual minorities. Broader awareness, education, and advocacy can contribute to a more accepting atmosphere. It may lead to lower stigma, discrimination, and prejudice towards sexual minority persons. Another tool that can positively enhance identity formation is social media. Social media allows identity development by pointing out that society should respond positively to changing definitions of personal identities within this digital environment. Different from this, Black gay minorities face intersectional stressors that are directed at LGBQ individuals of color. These stressors happen every day and vary among TGNC subpopulations. Nevertheless, a supportive environment is an important condition for a healthy revamp for LGBTQ individuals. Criticism of the prevailing models of identity development suggests more flexible paradigms by recommending further works on numerous distinct minority and majoritarian identities. Looking at the lives of nonbinary transgender college students; the other explains that college students who are black and queer are exposed to discriminations that deter their identity development8. Similarly, black queer women in the workplace experience tokenization, which also deters their identity development. Additionally, the way families respond to young peoples LGBTQ identities have an impact on family relationships and on the youths life.  The study emphasizes the complexity of family reactions in different socio-economic contexts, shedding light on how young people navigate their relationships with families. The adequacy of comprehensive demographic data in representing the intricacies contained by LGBTQ individuals is under question.  This study introduces the concept of queer data, calls to dismantle fixed classifications, and suggests creating more diverse surveys. Further, racial identity in higher education decolonization within the sociopolitical landscape of South Africa. Using Photovoice, the study investigates the stories of black queer students and their struggles towards finding belonging while examining transformations in prevailing representations brought about by these narratives. Black Masculinity Slavery had a significant impact on the evolution of black masculinity (Hook 2004, 8). The supremacist patriarchal norm of the slave era accentuated resistance from individual black males. Their desire for freedom was not only to free black males but also free black women. These black male abolitionists decried the degradation of black women often regarded as naked victims. Inherent with African culture, black man is considered masculine when his family is free. Therefore, slavery marked a significant point in the development of black masculinity. In order to maintain a harmonious stance on the challenges faced by trans-masculine students, the study employs black transfeminine thought and queer theory (Jourian and Laila 2020, 733). Any attempt to discuss black masculinity from white masculine literature is faulted for lack of sensitivity and focus. Contrary to Hook (2004, 8), these authors dispel the notion that black masculinity is oppressive through misogynoir and heteropatriarchy. According to them, black masculinity has evolved into a healthy, sustainable, and affirming force in sexuality studies. In the same vein, Mack (2009) identifies slavery as the foundation for the establishment of black masculinity. The author argues that the creation of Black Battlefield Codes as an oppressive force empowered black males with culturally specific masculinity. Scholars such as Henry Bibb, Reverend John Jea, and David Walker supports this view. The running theme in these studies is the significant role that community ethos plays in defining masculinity. Black masculinity was culture-specific and was influenced by communal views on spirituality and violence. Another earliest piece of literature published in 1992 deviated from the idea that masculinity is characterized by control and dominance. The author recommends a literary shift from patriarchal understanding of masculinity because it elucidates harmful stereotypes against black queer individuals . In addition, the author criticizes scholarly work on masculinity that were cased in urban environments. These literatures presented black masculinity as homogeneous thus represent men as failures, violent, dangerous, and sex lunatics. On the other hand, Young (2021, 438 – 439) attest the emergence of black masculinity to contention with hegemonic masculinity. Around 1960, literary studies on black masculinity begun taking center stage. Reviewing these publications, the author asserts that black people exhibited a considerable degree of vulnerability on matters regarding sexuality, public identity, and intimacy. While inferring to the extreme regulation and monitoring black male athletes are exposed to the author appeals for further analysis into the intricacies of this subject. Similar to Hook (2004, 8), Coleman-Kirumba et al. (2023, 33-36) addressed the need for present literatures to explore the positive impacts of black masculinity such as community and family support. Moreover, the author observes the shortage of literatures on black masculinity and of the ones that are available a greater portion addressed black masculinity in negative light. The research by Cooper (2005, 353) argued that mainstream images of black heterosexual men in existing literature reflect a bipolar picture. On the other hand, there were literatures that depicted the bad black man as hypersexual and criminal. However, there were other literature that depicted Good Black Man as one who tries to reduce blackness by subscribing to white cultural superiority. This binary representation affected the assimilationist actions of straight black men, since they strived to be identified with a more socially approved Good Black Man. Moreover, the author believed that the source of bipolar black masculinity is post-civil rights mainstream anxiety. The conflict stemmed from the new recognition that some black men must be included in the mainstream while the old persistent belief is that most of them should remain excluded. Bipolar black masculinity serves as a tool for categorizing who should belong in the groups, based on assimilationist criteria. Black Theology This paper addressed disidentification with Christian conversion evident in two James Baldwins novels, The Amen Corner and Just Above My Head. The various effects of this self-negation are examined starting with the disidentifications concept by queer theoretician José Esteban Muñoz whereby one works on using its terms, In Just Above My Head, conversion is further deconditioned through an act of queer sexuality that both consecrates homo sex and turns it into a storehouse. The paper describes Baldwins complex network of conversion, faith and sexuality from the standpoint of black queer . Moreover, another study argued that historically queering African American religious history is not stifled by conventional historical and archival research methods. It pushes historians to seek alternative sources from ethnographers, theorists, activists and non-scholars in order to uncover a rich queer history threaded through African American religious narrative. The article goes against the definition of African American religions that recognizes many different identities besides typical Protestant, male cisgender and straight people. In this way it singles out individual artifacts, like oral histories by E. Patrick Johnson and Monique Moultrie writings or others to validate them as important archival resources for an inclusive study of African American religious history. To begin with, the study contends that this is an inherent aspect of African American religions due to their historical situation – Anti-Blackness in North Americas Caribbean. Second, it encourages the marginalization of queer voices . Moreover, discussions on the intersection of black spirituality, camp performance and the black church ensued. The touches upon the issues of camp performance, according to which white gay male aesthetics supposedly have a similar feature in African-American church culture. A lot of the text is based on an assumption that black church with its improvisational elements and performance rituals has a campiness which here manifests as holy/unholy spirit for consecrating space for queer performative acts4. The author states that camp aesthetics are to be seen everywhere in the black churchs syncopation, music and ritual. In fact, this aesthetic is often linked to the life narrative of a white gay man; yet considering it in view of black church destroys stereotypes about camp still being characteristic solely for whiteness and gays. The text reveals how the revelation of holy/unholy spirit in the black church results to a deferral socially sanctions thus allowing generation between religiousness and lascivious or sexuality . This text is an autobiographical narrative of the person, Chaz or Chastity who describes use catching spirit in church as a way to be striking and become later on another tool for revealing homosexuals. This narrative spells out how spirit language enactment in the black church can serve as a platform to voice other identities, like those linked with gender and sexuality . The author studied question proposed understanding of black Messiah. Picking want to pick out pieces she creates as a tool in advancing womanist theology through a queer emphasis. This argument is in relation to others made Jesus as black and deeming this statement true about queer throwing away heteronormativity. Lightsey provides a gist of Cleages critique that points at racial oppression and blames black people for accepting such an accusative nature. Lightsey expands this critique to include those who might reasonably support the subjugation of black LGBTQ people. Highlighting that, as Lightsey puts it, black people have themselves accepted another false heteronormative theology. The presented challenge in this chapter is directed at Cleage and his followers to answer the questions that womanist/womanist queer theories put forth. This translates to an opening for Cleage and his followers towards a re-evaluation of their positions on theology, race colorism as well as heterosexuality from queer perspectives. This, in turn, the text underlines a key analysis of Christian doctrines and their effects on oppressed individuals especially concerning race ethnicity gender sexual orientation . Connectedness Focus on LGBTQ identities from an intersectional standpoint, analyzing the lives of Baby Boomers versus Millennials was common with the authors. However, the disparities erupted in how white LGBTQ individuals perceive their sexuality compared to BIPOC and Black Indigenous Peoples approach towards it. Delve into the intersectionality of oppressions faced by LGBTQ people. On the same note, explanations on how inequality continues through a process referred to as obscuring oppression and shift focus on strategies used by minority protests; color-blind racism can be found in both systemic sexisms allied with cissexism. Secondly, Quinn et al., 2019 investigate the intersectionality of stigma concerning minimal PrEP utilization among young Black GBM. It uses intersectionality theory to analyze how social and structural contributors, beyond individual behaviors, contribute to HIV inequalities. Moreover, the research on syndemic theory concerning young Black GBM men addresses social and structural disparities for creating health conditions associated with a syndemic perspective.  Identifies the larger systems of oppression that contribute to syndemic situations. Additionally, explorations on the psychological identification of different affiliations are needed to understand how individuals from all walks of life contribute to social action and how they are connected. Similarly, the interplay of race and ethnic relations within the LGBTQ community implied the message that even communities with money can habit intergroup racist practices just like systemic racism penetrating all aspects of peoples lives. It addresses the problem of invisibility and marginalization, specifically among LGBTQ people of color. The authors developed and emphasized intersectionality in the following aspects extensively. For instance, they addressed intersections between racial and sexual orientation identities within the African American queer subcommunity3. On a similar note, one investigated the intersectionality of racial and sexual identities among Black gay men4. In addition, some of the authors used an intersectional perspective in their research where they discussed the effect of race, class, and generation by establishing a relation between these factors among the LGBT community as the other wider social-political issues developed6. Further, the families were used as a case to epitomize how such commitments land on people while disclosing their LGBTQ+ inclinations or traditions and loyalty. In this respect, the two authors talked about the issues with ambivalent characteristics of dual identities. These authors actively contributed to discussions of the negotiation of insider/outsider status. Disagreements While there are common themes and overlaps in the studies conducted by the authors, there are notable disagreements and divergent perspectives on specific aspects of identity formation and intersectionality: When it comes to disclosure and development of self-identity decisions, family plays a very important role in the formation of identity3. However, hypotheses that black gay men live perils through their racial and sexual identities as they fight against prejudiced thoughts from both the African American society and LGBTQ+ were speculated4. It means that the family may not always serve as a positive impact. In the same vein, Bishop et al. looked at the timings of milestones in sexual identity development and differences thereof based on social identities and cohorts studied.  Contrarily, comprehensive teen identity creation that revolves around intersectionality, as well as ecological systems theory, requires emphasizing systematic disconnection along with the interconnectivity among different kinds of networks.7 Major School of Thought Identity Formation within African American and Latinx Communities: The murkiness of identity-making in African American and Latinx communities, descending into family dynamics, cultural guidelines about what it means to belong or not belong, room for self-discovery when determining who they are, a constant negotiation between being of somewhere as opposed to nowhere at all.3 The study focused on the significance of resistance and resilience during marginalization periods. Similarly, the challenges that Black gay men encounter when trying to combine their racial and sexual identities have a negative correlation between racial and sexual identity – meaning that the progress of the Black race could actually have bigger effects on gay development than vice versa4. Stigma, Inequities, and Health Disparities The studies show that racist, as well as homonegative, impact on healthcare experiences contribute to the formation of distinct groups engaged in medical mistrust among young Black GBM. Racism within LGBTQ+ Communities Giwa et al. focus on the issue of race relations and racism in LGBTQ+ communities, with an emphasis on color gay as well queer social service providers. This study sheds light on institutional racism that leads to the marginalization and invisibility of lived experiences by LGBTQ+ people of color Canadians. Following, theres an overall impression of unending oppression and discrimination being faced by the LGBTs throughout the world. The study emphasized that the inclusion of LGBT communities knowledge and skills within Community Psychology models on intervention can help in enhancing theory as well as interventions for anyone who is gay. . The studies underline the prevalence of racist as well as heterosexual effects on healthcare experiences, which contribute to forming certain groups that play a role in developing medical mistrust among young blacks. Impact of Social Change and Technology In one of the earliest studies, researchers focused on how social change affects sexual minority peoples lives in these diverse communities, with special attention to generational differences. Social media platforms offer a space where Black queer people can see and be seen. Social media presence is important, and by using various forms of content, including images, stories, or discussion posts, social media allows for a range of Black queer identities to be seen. This can be used to create a sense of belonging and validation. Future Directions Expanding the syndemics experiences to enhance future conceptualizations and measurements of those among young Black GBM is an area that has received little attention. Additionally, organizations should also move from focusing on how to avert homophobic oppression to adopting an orientation and considering the intersecting forms of oppression endured by LGBTQ+ individuals. Analysis The evolution of black queer literary studies was influenced by a variety of things. To begin, the existing political environment significantly enhanced rebellion from the black and queer community. Johnson et al.s (2020) study prefers to categorize the atrocities directed towards gay men from a political standpoint rather than a social one. In other words, stereotype and discriminations poised against black view was politically instigated and not socially. Earlier publications like Steven Epsteins work Foucaults History of Sexuality: Volume I discussed sexuality from sociology lenses. The limitation for producing literary studies aligned to the sociologist dimension is their insensitivity to biological dimension. Diaspora authors on black queer materials were accentuated to write from the developments instigated by James Baldwin. Regarding black religion, literary studies such as W. E. B. DuBois and Zora Neale Hurston considered black spirituality to have preceded American spirituality. When tracing the relationship between sexuality and black spirituality, Matthews (1998) acknowledges that lack spirituality or religion did not conceptualize black gay men neither were they identified among the spiritualists. Coupled with lack of identity form political spheres and psychological ideologies, authors begun to integrate black queer people into religious organizations and political movements. Further, culture was also identified to play a role in the identity struggle of the queer individuals. Through oral and written literature, studies communicated in convincing language acceptance, inclusivity, and support for black queer individuals. On the other hand, Foster (2010) argued against the intent of some authors to explain racism against black gay men. For example, Emmanuel Nelson and James Dievler just to mention a few write in an oversimplified manner Baldwins exploration of sexuality and race. Baldwins matter was of dire significance in the black queer identity quest. There is a conspicuous tendency for modern African-American homosexuality scholars such as Kendall Thomas and Marlon Ross to misrepresent Baldwins work and portray white gay men as the most endangered race. The inclusion of fundamental issues such as subjectivity in black queer studies and ordinary queer studies distorts harmony that exists between race and sexuality. Moreover, there is no denying the leniency of some black queer materials towards people of color. However, the deafening refusal of white Americans to study the intersection of sexuality and race. The silence adduces to the supremacy of white culture over black culture; the ability of white culture to hide under glaring black literature is flattering. Similarly, the authors focus on Michelle Daniel and Christina Browns use of internet including their online showcase series called Between Women focusing further onto its development into between women TV played a significant role in addressing masculinity. Changes in the treatment of same-sex female eroticism by mainstream media began with this platform. Additionally, the development of a virtual milieu for these characters extends beyond personification by positioning them in society and envisioning specifically as African Americans. This highlights the need to develop an expansive characterization of black LGBTQ+ individuals. In addition, Gates (202) looks into the background to study Bordeaux Academy of Sciences and its 1739 essay Who Blacks Are and Why. This battle around origins of blackness leads us back to topics discussed during Enlightenment. The different perspectives of the essays in competition lead to various origins for Africans which range from religious ideas and early scientific theories. These stories are defined as factors that promoted racist ideologies about intelligence and civilization. Significant focus is placed on the works of eminent Enlightenment thinkers like David Hume and Immanuel Kant, who are known for perpetuating perceptions that black people lack intellectual depth. The text shows the way in which these assumptions crept into Trans-Atlantic Slavery logic, thereby impacting other societal beliefs. The development of black queer literary studies originates from a complex interplay among political, social, cultural and historical factors. The major role played by the political atmosphere, as suggested in Johnson et al.s (2020) study amplified heterosexual atrocities against gay men resulted from political oppression rather than sociological setting as some authors suggested. Race, sexuality and politics intersected in the quest to establish a black queer identity literature beyond the simple accounts of racism against Black gay men. The importance of major diaspora writers, and primarily James Baldwin cannot be understated. The investigation of sexuality and race provided by Baldwin brought to the forefront a significant aspect in the quest for black gay identity, and papers such as Foster (2010) showcased some scholars failure to appraise Baldwin. In turn, the inclination among modern African-American homosexuality scholars to misrepresent Baldwins contribution and highlight endangered position of white gay men deprives black queer studies amenable concordance from race and sexuality. The conceptualization of black queer identity originated from the theories on Black religion and spirituality proposed by W. E. B DuBois as well as Zora Neale Hurston. It was part of a larger socio-political mobilization struggle for recognition and affirmation. Culture as conveyed in the oral and written literature at this time took on a significant role of communicating identity struggle for queered individuals by focusing acceptance of language, inclusiveness and support. On the other hand, Between Women showcase series by Michelle Daniel and Christina Brown can be depicted as a pivotal phenomenon in the field of mainstream media, which dealt with same- sex female eroticism. In the literary studies, creating a virtual space for black LGBTQ + characters highlighted depiction and community representation was essential in breaking stereotypes to make an inclusive narrative. On top of that, the historical background as revealed in Gatess (2022) commentary on the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences in which Gate traced how discussions about race developed within a great Enlightenment era. This historical account is important in the development of racial ideologies based on intelligence and civilization, with major authors such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant building perceptions of black peoples lack of mental ability. These thoughts filtered into Trans-Atlantic Slavery Logic which then influenced wider societal beliefs reinforcing those structures According to the studies, identity development is built on family and cultural norms, spaces in which people are given the opportunity to experience their own identities, negotiate an insider or outsider status continually, integrate a collective character, reach resistance against self or social forces that try to make some appearance other than initially intended. The studies also discussed the notion before implying that Black gay men find it hard to make peace with their racial and sexual identity, affected by biased views from African Americans. Black queer individuals must endure multiple dimensions of identity forged through race, sexual orientation, social habits, and cultural standards. Identity formation problems are, therefore, not only from outside but within their communities. In addition, collectively, the studies emphasize intersectionality as a part of identity formation. As noted, intersectionality is the reason for the historical and social assemblage of queer identities due to intersectional heterogeneity that results in limitations found within current models, especially those created based on the experiences of white gay men. Additionally, researching the issues obstructing identity building discussed race and sexuality intersections in African American gay men conflicts arising from two identities based on membership to both gaps culture and black one. As such, these studies have also brought out the role of social media in identifying criminals. Among LGBTQ+ youths, social media platforms enable them to develop their narrative identity where they can project an image of themselves as stable, secure, and authentic. Identifying identities as a second challenge is that they are dynamic and fluid. Moreover, the nature of gender and sexual identities among LGBTQ + is so dynamic that its also multiple, confusing people even more. The authors described the other challenge to forming identification as a relatively low integration identity. Some stated that even in their circle of black gay men, they were not appreciated.  They, hence, curl and are afraid of the deportation of immigrants as well as the cancellation of locals. Collectively, these sources underscore the complexity and controversies surrounding the construction of identities as intersections. They underline the need for broader methods and interdisciplinary frameworks and recognize that societal structures of discrimination and support networks shape the creation of various identities. In addition, the studies show that if one wants to understand how identity is formed among LGBTQ+ individuals with intersecting identities, then one must take generational changes, as well as cultural and societal ones, into consideration. Following, the studies on Black masculinity examine the use of the Internet, particularly that seen in Between Women by series showcases in an innovative way to undermine mainstream media stories. The introduction of a similar virtual platform intended to be used as characterization for different types of black lesbian and bisexual females may promote increased diversity as recommended in studies. However, the impact of website dispose assembly on difficult advancement blur has too been featured and mentioned more concerning social and business movements. For instance, an analysis of the 1739 essay contest offers some insight regarding how racial discussions started. It increases understanding of racist ideas by looking at different conditions in which Africans came about during this period. Also, though the article states that two ideologies contributed, more detailed analysis of how social attitudes towards essays were affected could be beneficial. By explaining the relationship between racial conceptions and Trans-Atlantic Slavery thought, we will be able to understand Enlightenment discourse better. Evaluation The process of identity development among LGBTQ+ is a complex one that involves multiple factors such as intersectionality, family life, resilience, and subcultures in communities, including evolving models about sexuality. This section explores these topics and identifies areas where current research falls short, indicating avenues for future inquiries. Further, the study analyzes the internet, especially between womens showcase series, as a tool for countering Mainstream media representation of same-sex female eroticism and queer identities. Furthermore, the production of a virtual platform that brings into focus an extensive spectrum of black lesbian and bisexual female portrayals is worthwhile in terms of how representation happens in media. At the same time, studying the representation of Black lesbian and bisexual characters on classic TV seri\xadals as well as Hollywood films allows for broader interpretation from a media perspective. Intersectionality in Race and Sexuality Also, many studies emphasize the idea of intersectionality and acknowledge that racial statuses, as well as sexual orientation identities, have interrelated aspects.3,4 A subtle approach should use factors like race, sexuality, gender, and socio-economic status. This theme underlines the importance of inclusive models that appreciate the diversity of experiences within the LGBTQ+ community. Regarding black theology, the studies are useful in the disclosure of a complex structure that unites black queer experiences into an accurate discussion on conversion, faith and sexuality. This questioning of these items challenges established historical practices, prompting the exploration beyond present literature that assists towards a better understanding of queer history for African American religious stories. Additionally, identity search gets stronger in a black church due to disruption of stereotypical views about camp aesthetics dimension. In contrast, womanist theology alongside queer pressure in black emissary unravels about racial enslavement and resistance against Black LGBTQ individuals. All these research deals with intersectionality by investigating intersections between race, sexuality and religious orientation. Family Influence on Identity Formation Family and the shaping of identity decisions keep being a motif. Family pressure plays a significant role in the decision to disclose and identify the expression of Black queer individuals.  The dynamics of families are vital in understanding the intricacy of LGBTQ+ identity development. Resistance and Resilience of Political Oppression Studies emphasize the importance of resisting marginalization and discrimination.8 Community and support networks play a key role in the positive shaping of identity growth, but they also reduce any negative development because of various challenges faced within society. Identification and strengthening of resilience are key parts of the formation of a holistic LGBTQ+ identity. Challenges Within Black and LGBTQ+ Communities There is discrimination even in the Black and LGBTQ+ communities. Black queer individuals encounter problems that are rooted in both racial and sexual identities, facing prejudiced views from each community.23 It should be noted here that stress disparities are very unique in cases of Black queer people, which calls for the need for more comprehensive studies. Generational Differences Furthermore, it acknowledges significant generational differences in the timing of identity milestones. These differences reveal the ways in which attitudes to sexual orientation are evolving within society and how they influence identity formation.  Understanding these variations is required in order to design interventions appropriate for different age groups. Gaps in Research Research gaps in the area of research are also present, such as conceptual models to define identity development stages, implementation of intersectionality framework into identity model inclusively or explicitly with detailed knowledge over racial tendencies toward ones identity based on sexual orientation, and the impact of social injustices directed on Black queer individuals mental health, and the role of social media in effecting social changes remain unexhausted. Along with the development of society, it becomes more complicated to understand identity formation in LGBTQ+ individuals. These analyses reveal key issues, pinpoint deficiencies, and provide recommendations for additional research to strengthen the development of an identity from an LGBTQ+ perspective that is bound by a greater scope, more considerable depth, and actionability. This knowledge is instrumental in shaping interventions, policies, and practices that foster the well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals as resilient people. This journey of identity development and social injustice against Black queers through various scholarly sources provides a full-on deep insight not only into the challenges but also problems within this intersectional space. The studies show a strong reaction to marginalization and suggest approaches for dealing with internalized oppression. It, therefore, emphasizes the reciprocity of racial and sexual orientation identity, a feature that stands out in linear models because it shows how important community support is to positive identity development. The Black gay men had a hard time trying to balance their racial and gender identities in an effort for them to be accepted by both the African American community as well as LGBTQ. For instance, there is an inverse correlation between racial and sexual identity development, which involves recognition of peculiar difficulties faced by Black gay men. Therefore, this study contributes a subtler understanding of identity development, concentrating on the struggle of double identities. Studies that deal with the homophobic elements within African American culture and gay life as white-identified provide insight into the idea of intersectionality and how challenging it may be to navigate identity-based on race, sexual orientation, and cultural norms. Additionally, the social construction of queer identities highlights some historical circumstances and characteristics related to available models. It follows the identity models, challenges heteronormativity, and examines conflicts within the LGBTQ community. Recommendations are made for the use of more inclusive models that incorporate transgender persons, people of color, and those who have multiple identities. On the other hand, the use of an intersectional approach when comparing LGBTQ individuals is significant in identity formation processes within their respective communities. With the impacts of gentrification, changes in social tolerance, and lived realities for low-income BIPOC LGBTQ individuals likely to intensify, insight into generational differences and the necessity of addressing a wider spectrum of socio-political issues in LGBTQ organizations is necessary. The concepts of intersectionality and ecological systems theory enhance understanding of the identity-making process among teens and advocate for a complex perspective. This research identifies crucial support structures for a variety of socialization contexts, dealing with several types of systematic inequality and related systems of repression, as well as the influence of power dynamics on it. Strengths and Weaknesses of Leading Arguments Various studies have made amazing contributions to research in identity formation among Black queer people; each study is not without its strengths as well as flaws. Through critical analysis, researchers can understand the present environment and points that need further development or discussion. Strengths Intersectionality: One of the recurring themes observed in numerous studies is intersectionality in identity formulation. Comprehensive models of identity development deepen the understanding of several different identities, race, sexual orientation, and gender. Using the intersectionality lenses, researchers can profile Black queer peoples lived experiences and their compounding effect on the formation of their identity. Historical Perspectives: Some studies offer useful historical events and explain how queer identity models evolved throughout history. This helps us understand more about the evolution of identities and how society created them. Perspectives on history create a background for considering current challenges and possible ways to develop identity further. Weaknesses Limited Exploration of Positive Aspects: Some studies indicate a low process of positive investigation concerning identity formation. Many times, people pay attention to problems like discrimination and adversity, leaving the positive side underexplored. If negative aspects are not taken into consideration, there is no room for understanding the fullness of such circumstances within which Black queer people can have a good life and be well. Limited Practical Applications: While theoretical ideas are used more commonly, some studies require better conversion of their outcomes into practical solutions. There is no connection between research results and practical actions or policies that can have a positive impact on peoples lives. Research that contributes to the development of support systems, theology, mental health interventions, and a more inclusive society must bridge the gap between theory and practice. While the materials provided by research on identity formation among Black queer people offer much exciting data, by verifying these shortcomings, researchers can make this field go forward. A stronger focus on more positive aspects, recognizable links to larger theoretical frameworks, and practical implications can make the body of knowledge much richer and applicable in practice, giving way for changes both at field-level research and at societal levels. Recommendations for Future Study Future studies on identity-making among Black queer individuals represent promising avenues for research and innovation. The following recommendations are vital for advancing our understanding of this complex and multifaceted process: Developing Inclusive Identity Models Modern identity models are not very inclusive, especially in the conditions of modern queer people, women, and transgender individuals. To make these models more meaningful and useful, wide-angled frameworks in the intersection of various identities should be developed. Future studies could investigate the smaller aspects of identity models to ensure that they are adaptable enough to accommodate all diversity within LGBTQ+. Investigate how these models can be changed more adequately to represent the individualized experiences of Black queer people. Conducting Longitudinal Studies Identity development is a flexible and open-ended process that occurs over time. The longitudinal studies provide researchers with invaluable insight into the ability to track changes, identify patterns, and discern trends that shape identity development at different stages of life by considering its variables. Longitudinal research should be carried out by researchers who track changes in identities over long intervals. Such studies can reveal the processes through which societal changes, cultural shifts, and personal experiences mold ones identity. Conclusion This research paper focused on the race, religion, sexuality, masculinity and identity in Black Queer Literary Studies pertaining to African American gay individuals. Through analyzing the role of family life, cultural beliefs and social prejudices that contribute to identity formation and challenges in Black queer population, this study demystified internal functioning processes inherent within their community. This study traced the developments in black literature studies with a view to make a significant contribution to better understand the accounts that arise from the intersection of U.S Black Masculinity, Black Queerness and Black Theology. The historical background, explored in Gatess (2022) commentary on the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences, illuminated the development of racial ideologies during the Enlightenment era. Authors like David Hume and Immanuel Kant contributed to perceptions of black people lacking intellectual capacity, influencing Trans-Atlantic Slavery Logic and broader societal beliefs. This historical context deepened the understanding of how racial ideologies permeated various aspects of society, reinforcing structures that perpetuated oppression. The evolution of black queer literary studies is intricately woven through the fabric of political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. The analysis revealed a profound impact of the political environment in the development of these studies (Johnson et al. 2020). Contrary to the prevailing view of many scholars that sexuality was a sociological issue, Johnson et al.s literary work highlighted the intersection of race, sexuality, and politics. Another act that shaped the direction of black literary materials was James Baldwin opposition towards political oppression, he influenced majority of diaspora writers into addressing sexuality from a political landscape. Some of the earliest authors materials on black religion and spirituality include W. E. B DuBois and Zora Neale Hurston. They also addressed the intersection of politics, religion, and culture on race and sexuality. Although, black spirituality literature existed before white spirituality but both did not accept queer individuals. On the other hand, the introduction of films addressing black sexuality by Michelle Daniel and Christina Brown played a significant role in challenging stereotypes and addressing same-sex female eroticism. These subjects infiltrated the academic cycles with sexuality being a subject of keen interest in philosophy classes. Looking into the impacts of social change on sexual minority people based on life course, narrative, and intersectionality perspectives. The studies go into generational differences and provide a comprehensive understanding of the different scenarios regarding people belonging to sexual minorities in changing societal values. It can better understand the role of social change in sexual identity development and minority stress. The studies emphasize that society needs to realign in order for people to view a modern, open multi-projection of identities. In addition, focusing on the intersectional stressors amongst the LGBQ black community but primarily focusing on sexual minorities in Black – Using minority stress theory and psychological mediation framework, studies identify how both distal-leveled of the proximal level of stress affect mental status within Black different identified as part belonging to the LBGQ group. Lastly, the study contributes to understanding present tendencies in gender identities among TGNC individuals by noting that such practices demand healthy environments for appropriate development. The challenges that biracial lesbian and bisexual women surmounted in demonstrating how gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual identity intertwine were examined. The studies make a general thrust towards mental health providers to understand the peculiar circumstances that are present for biracial sexual minority women. Further, the studies examined nonbinary transgender community members lives in the college sphere, addressing cisnormativity reproduction resistance. This research necessitates dismantling cisnormativity structures within universities and incorporating inclusive policies. A conceptual study of tokenism in influencing Black women at work, racism, and gender-based discrimination gives insights into the complexity of identity shifts among individuals with multiple stigmatized identities, shedding light on how workspaces can promote inclusivity. The results pointed to the severe and complicated nature of family reactions in various socio-economic conditions that shape LGBTQ youth service providers informed interventions. Nevertheless, investigations into gender and sexual identities suggested designing more comprehensive questions about erotic matters together with queer data or Sexual orientations as an amicable solution to this menace. In conclusion, these varied studies cumulatively offer a broad perspective on the issues and intricacies binding to identity development, specifically regarding Black queers. They discuss intersectionality, discrimination, social transformation, family response mechanisms, and how societal arrangements shape the lives of individuals with different identities. The findings highlight the necessity for inclusive models, supportive environments, and focused interventions to promote positive identity development, leading to improved well-being.', "Religion, secularism, and rights are interconnected ideas that greatly contribute to our diverse communities. Religion encompasses structured belief systems and practices with a spiritual core. On the other hand, secularism seeks to detach religious influence from governmental and civic matters, striving for impartiality and inclusiveness in societal functions. Discussions about rights involve acknowledging and safeguarding personal liberties, including the freedom of religious expression. Collectively, these concepts deal with the complex relationship among personal liberties, societal values, and governmental policies, particularly in societies with varied cultures and religions. This week’s reading by Selby, Barras, and Beaman's (2018) and the case Bruker v. Markovitz offer insightful perspectives on these themes. The article Secularism in Canada by Selby, Barras, and Beaman (2018), alongside the case of Bruker v. Markovitz from the Supreme Court of Canada, brings a legal lens to these discussions. The authors of the article dispute the idea of Canada as a religiously impartial nation, asserting its inherent Christian character. This dominant religion, often unnoticed in public discussions, profoundly affects non-Christian individuals' experiences. The article emphasizes Christianity's ingrained presence in Canadian society, where its practices and symbols are perceived as neutral, unlike Islam, which is often viewed as overt and non-neutral. The contrast between Islam's visibility and Christianity's invisibility in Canadian secular society is explored through different narratives, including workplace dynamics in which, religious practices like prayer start to face scrutiny and regulation. This is exemplified by the story of Akeem, a non-observant Muslim lab assistant, whose supervisor's well-intentioned actions unintentionally caused him discomfort and alienation (Selby, Barras, & Beaman's 2018). The Bruker v. Markovitz case further enriches this discussion. The Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in this case, concerning the enforceability of a commitment related to a Jewish religious divorce, illustrates the complex interplay between religious freedom and state involvement in religious matters. While initially framed as a contractual matter in Quebec, it deeply impacts the debate on religious freedom. Both readings and the case highlight the tension between secularism as a political and legal concept and its influence on individuals' daily experiences in a diverse nation. The concept of secularism in Canada, as examined in the readings, is dynamic, linked with defining and managing religion. This perspective implies that Canadian secularism is not just about separating church and state but also about recognizing and accommodating different religions in public life. The Bruker v. Markovitz case shows how secular courts handle religious practices and the difficulties in balancing individual rights with religious freedom and secular law. Reflecting on these materials, I am intrigued by the details of secularism in a multicultural and multi-religious context like Canada. The readings and the case shed light on the challenges of defining secularism and its implementation in a society where Christianity, as the majority religion, often remains unexamined, while minority religions such as Islam face scrutiny. These resources highlight the necessity for a deep understanding of secularism, one that acknowledges Canada's varied religious landscape and aims to respect and accommodate the rights and practices of all its citizens."]
