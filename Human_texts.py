Unlike some years back when music was simply a source of entertainment or motivation when going to war and work, education has given music the chance to explore its bounds and contributed effectively to the construction of the culture that presently exists. This paper analyzes not only the background of music education but also evaluates the different dimensions in which music can be defined and how it has impacted on the society. The establishment of cross-cultural music in Secondary schools contributes effectively to understanding philosophical arguments that are shared in the light of knowledge and reality. Focusing on the arguments shared about music education by Istvan Molnar-Szakacs in the book, Music and Empathy articles explicitly Music The language of Sympathy, this paper aims at a better understanding of music and its importance in education. Introduction Music is a more potent instrument than any other for education. The words of Plato generally reflect the ease at which music can enhance students ability to not only grasp but also understand the concepts taught in class. Cross-cultural music in schools opens up doors for socialization, creation of identity, and at the same time, improves the methods of learning. Arguably, music education has taken an upward trend since its growth and development. The evolution of music education can be traced back to the 1900s during the progressive era. The proposers of incorporating music education in the curricular argued based on increased capacity of knowledge acquisition and improved ability of the students to separate reality from illusions. Ideally, proposers of the incorporation of music in education were mainly encouraged by the research that revealed the benefits of music on the brain and the ability of the students to understand music better. This paper divides these aspects into three significant parts, which include existence, knowledge, and reality. Analytically, evaluating the application of cross-cultural music education in schools and gauging the impacts that it will have on the students can enhance the understanding of why music is beneficial to schools and societies. Part 1: Existence Background of the development of music education. Music education was considered slightly after the 1900s the common school movements when it was introduced. Ideally, moving music from the streets and the homes to the classroom was a huge step that raised questions about the motivating factors behind this decision. Before music was taught in class, most of the songs were sung during special events such as traditional ceremonies, there were also the work songs, mostly sung while farming, war songs, and hunting songs. This was the primary form of informal education taking place. During this time, music was mainly practiced during special occasions, and it never occurred to be a hobby or that it can be a talent. Following the pressures of advancements during the American Revolution era, an opportunity for music to be more than just a ceremonial or a ritualistic event came. The time of reforms in the American community urged that all forms of government had to take active roles in promoting and initiating the changes. This included the setting up of schools and incorporating music in the curriculum. As early as the 1880s, the subject of music as a subject in the curriculum had already been raised. With the help of the Boston School Committee and Lowell Mason, Boston Massachusetts was among the first schools to incorporate music into the curriculum. Ideally, the main reasoning behind this was that music was too broad to be left unexplored. Ideally, there was an already different type of music, and various instances where a particular song would be sung and instruments would be played. Most of the advocates for the inclusion of music in the educational curriculum argued that music was beneficial to the students in the following ways. It would aid in their mental growth since they learn the art of applying creativity and create harmony when performing. Secondly, the research provided that music contributed to the physical wellbeing of the person. This argument can be evaluated from various angles, all of which benefit the student. To begin with, a student is likely to benefit from physical fitness for him or her to be in apposition to dance. Also, the posture will improve since the person will have to practice frequently to ensure flexibility. Also, most people who will pursue music are passionate about it, which means that doing what they like will make them happy. As such, there will be a positive reflection of the music in the student's physical appearance in terms of smiling, dressing code, and even how the student associates with people. Thirdly, the proposers of music in the educational curriculum argued that it would be beneficial to the students to build and reinforce their morals. The first thing that students of music are likely to learn is the art of hardworking through regular practice. They also learn the concept of responsibility, such that they will be on time for practice, and will work towards getting where they want without any supervision. During the civilization era, music was a tool of empowerment, and this was after the history of black communities and hip-hop. Arguably, music was not only a comforter for these people but also a source of empowerment, and this is what schools required to boost the performance of students. Following these arguments and evaluations, music became a part of the educational curriculum in the US. Part 2: Knowledge Knowledge can be acquired through evaluation. As such, evaluating the contributions of music in Philosophical terms, sociological basis, and psychological angle can effectively enhance the understanding of why music is an essential additive to the school curriculum. Philosophical Basis of Music Education Philosophy refers to the study of concepts of reality, and existence, and how things occur in the environments. The idea of philosophical music education refers to the value of pursuing music education. In other words, the philosophical basis looks into the value of music to human life, or better still the contributions that music has to make a person feel good about him and society. Authors such as Dr. Upham associate music education to the possibility of having feeling full experiences. True to the argument that wages, music has a unique way of impacting an individual's emotions. The impact can either be positive or negative, depending on the impression that the person feels. Barbara explains, Jacques-Dalcroze utilized movement and kinesthetic awareness of the body to develop skills in analyzing, interpreting, and experiencing music in an emotionally and physically natural way, creating harmony between the temperament and the will, between impulse and thought” Ideally, evaluating the impacts that taking music as a course has had on students can be useful in understanding the concept of philosophical music education. Arguably, the philosophical basis of music education can be evaluated by asking why teaching music as a professional course is essential. Ideally, music contributes to learning language and reasoning. Arguably, music education is specific to the language. Through this, students get a better grasp of not only the spellings of a particular language but also the proper articulation of the words used in the language. The broad subject of language is learned better through music education since the students are also introduced to poetry concepts so that they can learn the most effective ways of composing music that flows with the rhythm of the song.   Additionally, the idea of teaching music both formally and informally contributes to the growth of the reasoning of the students. Ideally, the students learn to think outside the box most of the time. Preferably, there are times when they have to improvise, and this requires that a person have the capability of reasoning faster. Research has pointed out that music education promotes creativity, which aids in better performance for students in all sectors. Ideally, the ability of the student to comprehend the world differently clearly depicts aspects of creativity. Because there is a high affinity for improvising in music education, the concept of creativity fits, without much of arguments or efforts to resolve the issue, creativity that is cultured and nurtured by music education. Moreover, the philosophical conception of musical education explains to the teachers and the society what is best to teach in this course. Some of the concepts include musical skills or focusing on promoting an understanding of music in its totality. Also, there is the idea of generating musical appreciation, among the students and the society in general. Music can also be taught in terms of civic relations and the rules governing music performance and compositions. Ideally, the philosophical basis aims at understanding the aspects of musical education. Through this branch, learners and educators know that it is a rather wide subject than their perception of music education. In this case, the whole idea understands the meaning of music and the various features that it brings with it. Teachers have gone far and wide in explaining the concepts that constitute music. Ideally, music not only resonates around the art of singing and listening to songs. There are a wide variety of song types, there are genres of music, and there are also instrumentals as well as dances that contribute to making a musical performance a success. For a music teacher, there is the aspect of the musical performance being able to communicate to the audience. Also, these teachers have to ensure that the students understand the need for entertaining the audience, and this stems from the theme of the background, the costumes, and even stage utilization. Before the real performance comes to the stage, the audience must be in a position to feel the energy, enjoy the view, and expect to be mesmerized. That is when the teacher can know that the performance was a success. Sociological basis of Music Education This is the evaluation of music as a social construct. In other words, this is the evaluation of how music interacts with people in society and delves deeper into people's behavior in response to this. The sociological aspect of music has become a popular concept considering the rising positive vibes about music of different genres in contemporary society. Arguably, contemporary society has found ways to not only identify with music but also make music an essential aspect of culture. As such, people have developed various impressions and emotional attachment to music. It is common to hear people say that they listen to a specific type of music when they feel low. From this, it is evident that music is a social construct that a person might hear and feel better. Taking the hip-hop music, for instance, most of the lyrics are often a depiction of hardships that people have had to go through, but they were able to rise above all the limitations. Listening to this kind of music for a person who has been a victim of frustration is likely to cause an elevation in the spirit, and this means that this person will learn that problems are part of life. People can connect to music through different themes and levels. Ideally, some songs speak to almost everyone and every situation that a person is going through. As such, the society has grown to be dependent on music, not only entertainment but also personal benefits. Therefore, when teaching about music, teachers must consider the social impact that music has on the students. Students must learn that a song or a dance to be successful will depend on the message or the impression that the audience gets after listening to the song or seeing the performance. Most of the research points to the origin of music's sociological basis to the time of Fredrick Douglass. Ideally, Douglass found a way through which he could appeal to the black society.  From this aspect alone, it is evident that music is a sociological construct, and through it, communication is enhanced. The sociological basis of music has opened ways to several schools of thought. The sociology of culture, for instance, focused more on the relationship between music and culture. Ideally, various concepts of culture are captured in music. These cultural constituents can be seen as from the mere construction of the lyrics, to the style of performance. Gradually, music has become a wide institution to the point that it has become a culture of its own. Similarly, there is the sociological school of thought, which mainly focused on the relationship that can be established between music and subcultures. Music in the present society is mainly composed of the events that occur in people's daily lives and how they can deal with these issues. Research has pointed music to be one of the most effective ways of creating awareness in the present times. A good example is the music that is covered in 2020 is mostly about the COVID-19 pandemic. Arguably, music creates a platform through which people can connect with one another in society. Arguably, when communities that have been most affected by the pandemic listen to the song, they get the comfort that they are not alone and that people are still finding reasons to move on. Following this sort of encouragement, societies can rise above the limitation of the Corona Virus and adapt to the new normal. Other than that, music is also a form of political expression, and they present the common opinions and perceptions of the society concerning a leader or a certain form of leadership and understanding the mastery and internalization of musical conventions that are paramount to socialization. Dowd explains, “Some heed the corporal aspect of this process. Trial-and-error methods involved learning how to strike taiko drums to produce a pleasing sound and sense the unity of ensemble drumming via bodily motions”.  Music has a way of connecting to people to their cultural aspects and at the same time, promoting creativity. Music education is also inclusive of the use of instruments in enhancing the aesthetics of the musicality. The sociological perspective of understanding music is related to the ability of music to improve their productivity. Psychological basis of music education. Music relates to Psychology as a part of human behavior that Psychology aims at understanding. Over the years, human beings have found ways to connect to music through the various themes they create. Composers of music have adopted multiple titles such as Wake Up America and No Rose of no Man's land to express motivation or a call for action to the society at a particular phase. The psychological development of music in the community is not entirely bent towards understanding how music is human behavior. This is mainly because music in this concept can be analyzed based on the fact that it initiates a response that is then perceived as human behavior. When listening to a particular song, for instance, a person is likely to respond by nodding or closing the eyes as a sign of enjoyment, or in most cases, dancing to the tunes of the songs. The aesthetic aspect of a piece of music is the impression, instead of the component that the person gets from the song that makes him or her like it. This means that for one to adequately understand the construction of music and its impacts on the human brain, the person must be willing to go deeper. According to Parker, some of the sectors to evaluate include the “elements of frequency, form, amplitude, and duration are not music to the human until they are neurologically transformed to, and interpreted by the brain--as pitch, timbre, loudness, and time The psychology of human experiences regarding both the past musical experience and the present can be seen through the responses that the human experiences. In short, this study focuses on the brain of the person listening to music or who is exposed to any kind of music and an evaluation of how the person has responded to the sound and musicality. Research has proved that music cognition begins as early as in the womb when the fetus can hear sounds and make peace. For the many who have listened to white noise, there is evidence of sound and voice produced. Most of the time, white noise is a replication of the sounds of the heartbeat of the mother and the functioning of the body cells and organs in the body of the mother. These are the sounds that the fetus hears when it is in the womb. Following the calming effect that these sounds have on the brain, there is room for it to sleep comfortably, and that is why children are often able to sleep soundly when white noise is played. Arguably, music has a way of impacting on the brain of an individual. Through the cognition of different types of music and the analysis of the impressions that a person gets while listening to the music, the person gets a liking to a particular kind of music. Through the psychological basis of music, a student gets to understand the origin of musical stimulus, which is not only the cognition but also the musical environment. Part 3: Reality Western music and ways of notation The early tutors of music begun by teaching notations, and they would enlighten their students on the manners of singing using the western notations. The western notation is the most common type of notation that many composers adapt when making music. This is because of the universal nature of the notation and the fact that it allows universal communication and enables the creation of songs that possess a high aesthetic component. The earliest aspects of western notations came from European classical music, whose performance was unique in terms of the costumes and instruments used. Also, even though most of the songs in the classical music types were written in different languages, the notation made it easier for a listener to follow up a story and understand the message that the performer is trying to communicate. The design of classical music is considered one of the most challenging music types in society, mainly because of the difficulties in the composition and the efforts that a composer has to incorporate to succeed. Research has it that most composers are forced into going way back in research to the sixth century BCE Greek philosopher, mathematician, and musician, who is believed to be the founder of music. There is no better way to creating music than understanding from the source what music is and what it is intended to do. The mathematical concept of music has been extensively used to make codes, denotations, and even accounting for possessing during a performance or training. The modern forms of denotations have taken a different direction, considering that they have learned to incorporate aspects of the environment, such as setting up the theme. Also, there is the idea of depicting emotion through the tone, and the facial expression to get away through which the performer can connect to the audience. Following the modernization and the changes in the composition of demographics in American society and other societies, there have been changes in contemporary times that have been noted in the composition and notation of music. Factors such as changes in worldwide communication are a consideration when it comes to an understanding of the changes. Communication is depended upon the language and the ability of the target audience to be able to understand the message. In the case of the US present society, for instance, there are many ethnicities with different kinds of notations in their mother language. Even so, musicians targeting the whole of US society have to take this factor into account and produce a piece of music that is directed at universality. Similarly, the concept of culturally musical approaches might be impactful when it comes to an understanding of the present notation and the composition of music. Composing music may be simply made of elements of culture and aesthetics. As such, it is evaluating the culture can prove to be important in that many artists have begun borrowing instruments of classical music and using them in jazz and hip hop music. As much as this is considered a new aspect of creativity, it is one of the most successful music history inventions that has been made possible by cultural interaction. Also, the fact that different musical connotations are required for the production of different types of music explains the evolution of various notations in contemporary society.  The most commonly taught kind of notation is the de facto standard. The knowledge acquired here is passed down from teachers to students through the application. There are many musicians in modern times that sing more than one language in a song. These are the perfect examples of artists who use different types of notations to ensure continuity and the expression of aesthetics. Music education must be applied equally across the students who are looking to enroll. Agreeably, music educators have to ensure that all the students are not only grasping the concepts but are also keeping up in the rightful capacity to ensure that they get the required ideas. Just like any other subject, music is broad. If the student fails to pay attention properly, he or she might miss out on essential factors, which may impact the students ability to compose and present music. Success factors are as crucial as any other subject. Therefore, students have to be serious when it comes to an understanding of the aspects of leaning music according to what the teachers are enlightening them about. Research has associated an increased attention span to music. Stanford medicine center informs that The brain partitions information into meaningful chunks by extracting information about beginnings, endings and the boundaries between events Arguably, music has a way of making people pay attention to. Therefore, the educators of music must take advantage of this situation and work towards ensuring that all the students are effective in learning and understanding music. Contemporary society has learned to incorporate music as an essential component of culture. This means that it is a source of entertainment. Arguably, the fact that music is both an educational concept and a source of entertainment is reason enough as to why educators have to try their best to ensure that students grasp all that is required for them to be successful producers and artists in the future. Conclusion In a nutshell, music education has proven to be a nice program incorporated in the educational curriculum. Agreeably, music education finds ways through the students and connects them not only to the society but also widens their socialization capacity. Other than that, it has come to the attention that most researchers have found that music instills values in students. For instance, through music, students learn the art of hard work, especially since with music they have to practice continually. Also, they improve their communication abilities since they get a better understanding of the musical concepts in society. Students learn the art of practicing continuously, and applying these features to learning other subjects contribute to better performance overall. They understand the conceptions as well as the cognitive ability of music aids in understanding the importance of incorporating it in education. Cross-cultural music should be part of the curriculum, and students should be encouraged to pursue music", "The Jeep Wrangler operations are limited to rough terrains and therefore not quite convenient for open roads.   For instance, driving a Jeep Wrangler on asphalt is quite tiring since it involves a lot of attention due to the smooth terrain (Rosenbaum, 2007). In addition, the maximum speed of a Jeep Wrangler on the open road is slow compared to other big models.   Apparently, it is good to have a vehicle that can perform above average on both the off-road and open road. In this regard, this is why the new Ford Bronco stands a better chance to serve in different terrains than the Jeep Wrangler. How the product solves the target market's need The new Ford Bronco is a relief to people who operate in areas characterized by both the rough terrain and open roads. Under the rough terrains, the new Ford Bronco can endure long distance moving at an average speed due to its sufficient fuel holding capacity. In addition, the driver has nothing to worry about upon reaching the open road since the new Ford Bronco is designed to operate in any topography (McCarthy, 2007). The New Ford Bronco is not hard to drive on the open road like the Jeep Wrangler. Therefore, the driver does not get exhausted especially when driving in an area of non-uniform topography. Moreover, the new Ford Bronco has larger storage capacity compared to Jeep Wrangler thereby making it the favorite for long distance driving. In summary, the new Ford Bronco is the solution to the challenges presented by the non-uniform topography when driving from one region to another.", 'Student`s name:\nInstructor:\nCourse:\nDate:\nBeer Wars Documentary\nExecutive Summary\nAnat Baron, the mastermind behind the documentary “Beer Wars” was once an insider in the beer industry. She produced the documentary with the aim of finding out what makes or breaks a small brewery in relation to the competition they get from the larger brewing companies. She featured Stone Brewing Company, Boston Beer Company and Dogfish Head who are among the independent beer producers in the documentary. Anat Baron, who directed the documentary, explores the beer industry in the U.S revealing the truth behind the label of the popular beer brands. She shows the behind the scenes of the day-to-day battles and all-out wars that dominate the beer industry in America. This documentary is an entertaining journey, which reveals the unexpected turns and promises that will change the world’s opinion on the infamous ninety-nine beer bottles on the wall. \nThe Industry\nIn the Beer Wars documentary, Anat Baron explores the beer industry in the United States. Beer is recognized as a popular alcoholic beverage in the globe whose consumption has grown significantly during the past decade. The United States was the second largest producer of beer, coming in just after China with more than 200 million hectoliters of production. Big players such as Heineken Holding, AB InBev, SABMiller, Asahi Group Holdings and Kirin Holdings control the beer market in terms of global dominance. The AB InBev beer company was ranked as the first globally with sales of up to 45.6 billion dollars for the year 2017. The company`s focus on brands paid off when their brand, Budweiser had a total value of around 15 billion dollars in 2017. Bud Light and Heineken were recognized as the most popular beer brands for the year. According to statistics from the US beer market, around 34.17 billion dollars came from sales in 2016. The convenience stores are also key players by contributing to a third of the beer volume followed by grocery stores as the most significant distribution channels. \nBeer Import\nAccording to Baron Baron’s documentary, American beers are not only consumed in America but also all over the world. This makes the United States a great importer of beer. The beer brands are diverse, from all around the globe. Modelo Especial is the most popular brand that is owned by Grupo Modelo, a beer producer, and distributor which was established in 1925. Grupo Modelo brews and distributes up to 14 different brands of beer. The company’s presence is felt in over 180 nations. \nAnat Baron’s Research\nAnat Baron got an invitation to the convention on the beer industry, held annually and decided to film the event. She got access and filmed it by including methods like interviewing people one on one by sitting down with them and conversations by moving around and talking to the people in attendance. She also sought permissions to document the whole trade show and filmed the parties involved. After this event, she went on to Denver where the Great American Beer Festival took place. The show was consumer oriented. She had ten interviews, which were pre-arranged. She met Sam Calagione who was a representative of the craft beers and Rhonda, the pioneer of a new brand of beer that contained caffeine. In her desire to look into the issue from the point of view of the small brewers and corporations, she traveled throughout the country to more than twenty locations. She interviewed beer experts, those involved in the distribution, retail sector, and lobbyists. She then took eighteen months and a host of editors before the collaboration with Doug Blush to work on the story and release the documentary. \nWhat is happening in this industry?\nFrom this documentary as the name suggests, Beer Wars, there is a war between small brewers and the corporate behemoths (Beer wars n.p). The small brewers are challenging the powerful corporations as they create different beers in innovate ways. The documentary is about a story told by two main small brewers Rhonda Kallman and Sam Calagione who are battling with the tactics and might of corporate America. These corporations include Anheuser-Busch, InBev, and MillerCoors who have dominated the industry and are not willing to cede an inch. However, these two entrepreneurs struggle on to achieve their American dream. This story is likened to that of David and Goliath. The key players in the beer industry include the brewers who are involved mainly in production, the distribution, retailing and other relevant authorities like government lobbyists. \nThe documentary is eye-opening because it practically shows how Anheuser-Busch’s market share dominance as the largest company in the beer industry has grown progressively as the years go by. The company had a small market share of around twelve percent in 1965, and by 1985, its market share had steadily risen to thirty-seven percent. In 2005, its market share had grown to a very significant forty-nine percent meaning that one company controlled nearly half of the market share in a $100 billion market.\nWho are the key players?\nLarge Corporations\nThe large corporations mentioned in this documentary are not only large producers of beer consumed in America, but their beer is consumed all over the world. According to Anat, of every two beers sold in the U.S, one is by Anheuser-Busch. The remaining, 25% comes from MillerCoors. These two companies became even a stronger entity as they combined their operations in distribution in the year 2007 (Rowles n.p). In many beers, in the U.S the beer options offered is either from Anheuser-Busch or from Miller Coors. Although these beers are not the best, most of the shelf-space even at grocery stores is devoted to them. The large corporations have the power of dominion over the beer industry. They have been operational for several decades, and their brand is well known by many consumers. They also have better distribution systems and financial capability as compared to the smaller brewers. According to Anat, the large companies like Anheuser-Busch who are referred to as the king of beers are all about control and dominance (Beer Wars n.p).\nCraft beers\nIn Beer Wars, Anat focuses more on the two small independent beer manufacturers who produce craft beer. Sam Calcagno is the president and founder of a craft brewery called the Dogfish head in Milton, Delaware. Dogfish was by then the fastest growing small brewery in the U.S (Beer Wars n.p.). It was named as the only brewery in the fastest growing private companies listing Inc.500 list. Sam has written many books about brewing and entrepreneurship. He was also in the process of expanding his business. He was constructing another new brew house with a loan of 9million dollars that he was undertaking. The other person featured beside Sam is Rhonda Kallman who founded the new century Brewing Co. She is a veteran in the beer industry with more than 20 years expertise experience in sales, marketing and distribution.  She was a co-founder of the Boston beer company alongside Jim Koch. The Boston beer company are the makers of Samuel Adams who started in the year 1984. She was honored by the Institute of Brewing Studies with an award for being the “Pioneering Woman in the beer industry.”\nBy the time of shooting the documentary, Rhonda was introducing a new brand of beer that contained caffeine. Anat focused on the craft’s brewers’ advertisement and marketing and the myriad of obstacles they face when trying to penetrate the market. Her beer brand moon shot was quite an innovation. It is the very first beer in the U.S that had caffeine content in it. Rhonda’s aim is to produce an “energy beer” for the craft beer consumers. Although there had been no much effort, she is very hopeful that her unique beer will find customer base and investors (Beer Wars n.p.).\nCraft beer consumers buy based on the taste as opposed to the large corporations who sell based on profits and image. Craft beer drinkers are drawn to the notion of beer being artisanal and handcrafted with the use of quality ingredients. Therefore, there are more innovations that small brewers incorporate in their production. Some craft brewers respond to dietary gaps by producing gluten free or low carb beer. Craft beer emerged from the culture of home brewing. This was after decades of consolidating and homogenizing the beer sector. There are over 1300 craft brewers in the U.S who are growing their market share slowly but steadily although they still face competition from the large corporations (Beer Wars n.p.)\nWho has what power in the industry?\nThe three-tier system\nIn the beer, industry there is an antiquated probation era distribution system. This system requires beer producers to sell their beer to distributors who in return sell to retailers. This is called the three-tier system. It was supposed to keep the brewer away from the retailer to prevent them proving any incentives. This system is more of a disadvantage to the smaller brewers as the larger corporations still provide incentives. For example, the Anheuser-Busch help decide what beer goes on the shelves. They can never give up a spot for any other beer even when its sales are higher than those of Budweiser which is their beer.  The three-tier was meant to separate the brewers from the taverns. However, it has just created successful distributors. These distributors are so powerful that in 2006 their action committee outspent guns and tobacco combined. One of the small brewers in the documentary was almost thrown out of business by the big brewers since they were offering free cases and exclusivity to the retailers. Although the three-tier system only favors the bigger players, the craft brewers keep silent about it. This is because badmouthing the system would make them lose distribution. \nDistributors\nDistributors have a tendency to favor big beer companies in their work. This is because their payments depend on the quantity of beer delivered.  In Beer Wars, big beer companies and manufacturers have great control over beer sales volumes. It means that when the distributors make their deliveries, they tend to give the big beer companies great presence on their shelves. They actually receive many incentives to do this (Beer Wars n.p.) To the small brewers, this means that they are in a greatly disadvantaged position in regards to pushing their products in the marketplace and to the consumers. \nThe three-tier system of distribution has a few advantages. Brewers of craft beer and importers would have a rough time looking for trucks and warehouses necessary to aid in the distribution of beer over vast states without any help. Without distributors who are independent, the small-scale brewers might be limited to making their distribution in a very small area. By dealing with the distribution of more than one brand, independent distributors make trucking and warehouse storage highly efficient. The option in which they offer the products of a number of suppliers, a retailer may require a maximum of two deliveries in a single day because it is able to address its beer needs by transacting in the venture with a smaller number of distributors. The benefits trickle down to retailers who do not need to deal in large beer quantities within its stores because of direct delivery (Beer Wars n.p.)\nCompetition\nCompetition between the craft brewers and the larger corporations is stiff since the larger corporations have created a monopoly that they struggle to maintain. When they feel like their space at grocery stores is being encroached by craft brewers, they create another beer size or new type to take up more space. This is the reason why a beer like Budweiser can be found in cases, cans, 12 packs, 6 packs, mini-cans and bottles (Rowles n.p). The conflict between craft beer and Big Beer has gotten stiff as the big brewer companies have actually had to recognize the craft beer as a powerful competitor. There have been incidents of back and forth engagements between the craft beer and companies that are big brewers in the industry.\nAB in In Bev and Miller Coors comprise at least 72% of the beer sales within the United States. However, craft beer is a growing market that continues to expand to this day. Big beer companies, on the other hand, have gone on the offensive instead of recognizing the craft beer as a market dictated by its niche. Because of this development, big beer companies spend around $ 1.5 billion on advertisements (Rowles n.p). This huge amount of cash is spent on boosting the number of sales of beer sold. It is one of the reasons why the big manufacturers are somehow losing to the brewers of craft beer since they are not focused on the quality and taste of beer, which the craft beer makers have capitalized on.\nIn the marketing arena, many companies have been borrowing a leaf from craft beer.  This has been through investment in social media, stunts and authentic character of the beer. Some of them twist the messages into forms that speak against craft beer. The Budweiser Super Bowl ads are an example, which highlights the uniqueness of Budweiser, that it is not any form of craft beer. This is a direct attack on craft beer. Craft beer makers, on the other hand, have tried to clinch to their share of the market by differentiating their products as opposed to the advertising form that has been taken by the big beer companies. They are innovative with their beer and have actually upheld their stance in coming up with high-quality brews, helping them to stand out from the rest of the competition.\nAnheuser-Busch has actually taken a step further to purchase a number of small beer companies, which they have been selling as craft beers. These are produced in mass quantities in one of Anheiser-Buch`s factories. Lawsuits are another approach which the big beer companies use to frustrate the smaller craft beer companies. Beer Wars shows how one of the craft brewers was sued by Anheuser-Busch since it was using a name which was affiliated with the brewer. The issue was that Anheiser-Busch was not using that name for quite some time. This brings us back to the issue where brewers of craft beer are not financially capable to adequately address the huge number of lawsuits arising from large beer manufacturers. The main reason for this is that it is difficult for the brewers of craft beer to focus their resources on such things because craft breweries funding is not easy to obtain.\nInvestors\nInvestors in this industry either inject cash in huge ventures or small startup ventures. Most of the time, brewers of craft beer are placed in the middle of this classification in relation to their funding needs. Due to this, obtaining funds for the setting up of breweries for craft beer is extremely difficult through being normally financed. Political issues also affect the industry. \nGovernment lobbyists\nThe documentary, Beer Wars, indicates that beer lobbyists are among the most powerful lobby groups in Washington. These lobbyists have focused mainly on ensuring the maintenance of the three-tier system of distribution (Beer Wars n.p.). This distribution system, which categorizes the three main groups involved in the production and distribution of beer was established with the aim of ensuring fair sales of beer within the stakeholders involved in the process. One of the main reasons was so that the big beer companies could not restrict other smaller companies form placing their products on the shelves of stores. However, what is happening currently is the opposite of this. People engaged in the beer industry have to continually involve themselves in intense lobbying in order to push Congress to pass legislation that is favorable. In this regard, small-scale brewers spend a lot of time and many financial resources in pushing for legislation to be passed which would enable them to get discounts from the excise tax, which are availed to big brewer companies. \nEthical considerations\nEthical considerations in the beer industry are one of the main issues that need to be addressed. This is along the line of marketing ethics that need to be upheld and most importantly the element of social responsibility, which beer firms and companies have to adhere to in order to ensure the common good is maintained. In business, ethical considerations need assessment in consultation with various stakeholders and upon an assessment of the industry from a positive and negative outlook. \nThe increase in competition within the beer industry has resulted in many firms using greater proactive forms of advertisement. Most organizations that are involved in consumer advocacy have stated that the beer industry advertisements have really invested on advertisements, which have resulted in attracting young beer consumers, where some are under the legal age for drinking. The Federal Trade Commission conducted a thorough investigation into the alcohol and beer marketing practices. The FTC concluded that self-regulation by the industry functions well in regards to the alcohol and beer advertisements. \nThe investigation also deduced that a majority of the advertisements by the industry were acceptable with a lesser percentage of alcohol and beer marketing being unethical. The Anheuser-Busch advertisement that rode under the guise of inspiring to connect with fans of a number of sports by applying colors of the college team on cans of Bud Light. The FTC in such a case was concerned that the campaign would promote binge and underage drinking on campuses of colleges. Kin this case, there was no formal investigation, but the FTC warned the stakeholders in the beer industry that such a campaign should not happen again.\nConclusion\nThe Beer Wars documentary was a very eye-opening outline of the beer industry. Baron as an expert in the business and an experienced manager has the mindset of an insider when it comes to the alcoholic beverages market and corporate environment, which is attached to them. Her film encompasses all aspects, covering the big companies involved in the beer industry, which comprise of Anheuser-Busch and Miller Coors and the small-scale beer companies that are fighting to get a foothold in the industry. Baron takes us through the inner workings of the beer industry. This ranges from the production of beer and the process involved to the time of stocking on the shelves of stores. Beer Wars is a mixture of different styles, information and storytelling elements.', 'In this case, the issue is if it is morally right or wrong for the sociologist not to report the car-theft ring to the authorities. The parties involved in this case are the sociologist and the people who are involved in a car-theft ring. Other parties involved are the slum people who disclose the information and the authorities since they have the duty to maintain law and order. Identify what virtues are at stake or which relationships of care are at stake The relationships which are at stake, in this case, are the mutual interpersonal relationships as well as interpersonal conformity. The sociologist should keep a mutual relationship like respect royalty, trust, and gratitude and not report the car-theft ring to the authorities. The sociologist needs to be good to the subculture own eyes and those of other persons since if the people in the slum do not report the ring then she should respect them. The sociologist should be aware of the agreements, feelings, and expectations that should take primacy over personal interest. Nevertheless, the sociologist is in a dilemma for she can decide to differentiate the societal point of view from interpersonal motives and agreement and in order to avoid system breakdown she can decide to report the car-theft ring to the authorities. What is your personal take on this case? Personally, I think the sociologist should not report the car-theft ring to the authorities. The people have accepted the sociologist and have gained trust in her and that is the reason they are disclosing that information and in case she reports to the authority she could have broken the mutual interpersonal relationship as well as interpersonal conformity. It is the duty of the sociologist to respect the agreement and the trust she has gained from the slum people.', 'The modern American police force has borrowed some of its means to serve people from the England police service units. American law enforcement agencies have adopted; the strategy of a patrol that is preventive, the quasi-military design of organization, and the mission of control and crime prevention from the London police department. In addition to the three elements, the Americans have borrowed other British systems of policing thus the two systems exhibiting a lot of resemblances. In both America and Britain the police have limitations on their authority. This has led to the protection of individual liberty, which has brought in limits on both police authority and the government. Americans have also borrowed the local control of police agencies from the English (Champion, 2003). Many countries have central and national law agencies of enforcement, but this is contrary to both the Americans and the English. In America, the systems of law enforcement such as the police are controlled by the state, local and federal government. However, most American departments are local municipalities. A defining feature that has shown how heavily the American policing has borrowed from the English is the fragmented and highly decentralized systems of law enforcement (Champion, 2003). Lack of co-operation and co-ordination among the law enforcement agencies in America has served as a characteristic of the America law enforcement systems. The quasi-military organization structure in the modern England can describe the Anglo-Saxon policing witnessed in America. Despite all the similarities the American policies have with that of the English, there are also differences. The most significant difference is that there is no political influence of the policing institutions in Britain as compared to the robust political relationship seen with the American policing units (Champion, 2003). This political influence has led to lots of ridicule of the American policy which has led them to be termed as corrupt and a unit that lacks professionalism. Part 2 Modern fire safety standards and codes trace their origins from the 19th- century. In the 19th- century fire extinguishing was characterized by automatic sprinklers (NFPA 5000, 2006). Since the beginning sprinklers have performed as fire extinguishers but they were originally installed in different methods which led to their reliability is uncertain. The fire code was originally known as” Building Exits Code”. The name exists due to the efforts of making factories safe in the 19th century. The code mainly focuses on fire escapes and fire drills in the bid of reducing increased fire deaths in factories. Some of the original fire codes include •    Building owners must ensure that their fire exists point have no obstacles and obstructions. They were also required to keep their records of each inspection •    Fire sprinklers should be installed in all buildings that hold a capacity of more than a hundred people. •     In any meeting that involves more than fifty people, there should be a fire expert present. However, this code excluded religious meetings and gatherings. America has experienced numerous changes in the 21st century. Growing technology characterizes the change. This has led to the fire code growing regarding scope. The fire extinguishers units have incorporated protection of interior finish, detection systems, and alarms as a way to reduce the effect of fire calamities. The original codes have been reviewed and updated to suit the changing fire scenarios. The codes have been used to influence and ensure that the fire safety requirements are met and enforced.', 'For the prices to remain stable, the quantity of goods and services could have been maintained at the same level with the money supply. This is because a slight distortion in the money supply would influence people’s income and therefore affect the quantity of goods and service available in the market. The gold standard is not a good idea for modern macroeconomist for various reasons. For instance, it is hard to value goods and services in terms of gold. The gold standard does not give certainty on the amount of gold that should be exchanged for a unit of any good or service. In addition, the gold standard is not a good idea because it is challenging to carry gold from one place to another especially when in large quantities. Basically, for a commodity to serve as money, it must be portable. Question 5 Richard Nixon took power when the USA economy was at its weakest growth. Nixon’s predecessor was passive on the advice given by his economists and, therefore, established economic policies that could not match the needs of the USA economy. On assuming power, Richard Nixon worked closely with the country’s economists and made lucrative reforms in the economic structure of the country.  The reforms revived the USA economy and improved the economic growth to a greater percentage (Collins 98). Some of the reforms that Richard Nixon introduced included the revision of investment tax credit bill and exception of two million poor citizens from tax rolls.  During his tenure, the USA economy was revived, and cases of unemployment, price instability, and inflation were reduced at a great percentage. In essence, Richard Nixon was a strategist when it came to economic affairs.', 'The culture of a company is powerful since it has a significant impact on recruiting efforts, sales, profits, and employee morale, either negatively or positively. According to Tsai (2011), the culture of an organization reflects its beliefs, values, and behavioral norms, which the workers utilize to give meaning to scenarios they encounter. As such, it influences the attitude and behavior of employees within the company. Therefore, employee engagement within organizations plays a crucial role in employee turnover, job satisfaction, levels of productivity, and retention rates in a company. A good employee relationship helps increase productivity within a company because it creates a thriving atmosphere in workplaces (Eaton & Kilby, 2015). For this reason, employee morale and motivation increase, which is translated to improved productivity and efficiency. Also, good employee relation increases employee loyalty, which improves employee retention rates. For this reason, the company cuts off the cost of hiring and training new employees. An example of a company with good employee relations is Facebook. According to Loudenback et al. (2016), Facebook is known for its inclusive company culture and fascinating perks. It depicts why it has a wide array of happy employees, with 97 percent reporting job satisfaction. In conclusion, good employee relationship plays a crucial role in the success of a company. The same scenario applies to family relationships. A family with a healthy relationship is successful because there are no conflicts, and they support one another as opposed to a family with poor relations, which disintegrates. I have seen breakup in families because of having a strained relationship. Therefore, organizations must embrace healthy work relations in their culture.', 'Validity of Arguments Assessment\nName:\nCourse:\nInstructor:\nInstitution:\nDate of Submission:\nIntroduction\n\tThe construction of the truth tables is the best way of assessing the validity of any arguments conclusively. The odds on the truth tables get determined by the number of possibilities, reachable at any particular time by anyone that has the knowhow of the importance of the truth tables. Since the truth table I created and those created by my classmates are identical, one gets to realize that construction of truth tables follows one common procedure. All possible conclusions get determined by the number of the variables in a particular situation.\n\tWe all got to broke down the arguments into component statements, rewrote the premise and conclusions symbolically and further rewrote the argument as an implication with the conjunction of all the premises as the antecedent, and the conclusion as the consequent. Further we all got to complete the truth table for the resulting conditional statement. In case the conditional statement is a repetition, then the argument is valid; else its invalid. Each argument got restructured as a direct statement, mostly the original statement, converse, inverse or contrapositive statement. Some statements proved to be valid while some others proved invalid.\n\tTruth tables are a great way of proving the validity of arguments. Although, some arguments might turn out to be argued invalid logically, truth tables retain uniformity irrespective of the individuals creating the truth tables as long as they follow the formats acceptable in creating them. The arguments in contention get restructured in a similar way by anyone that follows the set rules, hence the uniformity we obtained on the exercise.', 'Considering that I am of African American descent, I decided to visit a Hispanic ethnicity group. During the meeting, I noticed some patterns of interaction within the group that differed from the ones accustomed. For instance, I noticed that within the group, the elders had a greater say on the proceedings of the group, with their opinions having a strong impact. In Hispanic culture, age plays a crucial role in determining the respect an individual receives in society (Garcia, 2017). The interaction was different from my culture, whereby the status of an individual dictates the level of influence he or she can have. I also noticed some words and non-verbal behaviors that differ from the ones I usually use. For example, the people in the group referred to visitors as “Pasiero,” which I came to understand that it is a slang word used in referring to a friend. Further, I noticed that the familiar hand gesture of summoning an individual to come over by using one’s index finger extending in and out when the palm is up has a sexual meaning among the Hispanic population. Hand gestures are usually different depending on the culture, which is the reason behind the importance of learning different cultures before interacting with them (Matsumoto & Hwang, 2013). Being the minority in the group that I visited did not feel bad at all. The group was welcoming, and they were so excited to have me as their guest. They welcomed me with some food and drink, and were also interested in helping me learn their language. The reason behind their welcoming nature may be because of their culture of living as a nuclear family, as it allows them to be compassionate to others (Otters & Hollander, 2018). Generally, it was an experience that I cherished.', 'Charles Prosser, David Snedden, Booker T. Washington, and John Dewey are some of the progressive movement personalities that have had an immense impact on the development of education legislatures in the past century. The underlying argument in this essay is that, although the visions and desires of some of the progressive movement personalities were not achieved to their full expectations, their contribution towards educational legislature in the early 20th century has, and continues to influence the modern-day educational legislation, policies, and practices. \nThe understanding of the influence of the progressive movement era on educational legislation requires the examination of the prior educational movement, particularly before the civil war. According to White, classical education, which involved the teaching of history, language, and literature, was the dominant educational movement (85). The movement focused more on preparing students for college and scholarship and largely ignored the technical and trade skills that were necessary at the time. Most of the contributions of the progressive movement personalities, therefore, are based on the attempt to break away from the classic educational movement and adjust to the social and economic needs of the time.\nBooker T. Washington, the most influential African American in the late 19th and 20th century, for instance, advocated for industrial education as opposed to classic education, which seemed to have been the favorite of African Americans, particularly the ex-slaves and their children. Washington, through the Tuskegee Institute, believed that African Americans had a better upwards mobility path in the US through adopting the Southern elite-favored industrial education, which nevertheless limited the social, economic, and political activities of the blacks (Mixon). Although Washington has significantly been criticized for pushing for African Americans\' tolerance of the discriminative educational policies of the Southern elites, it is evident that the representation of African Americans in America\'s middle class remains significantly low even in the 21st century (Mixon). On the contrary, modern vocational education, whose principles are fundamentally similar to Washington\'s industrial training, has provided a better opportunity for African Americans who fail to reach university or college education level.\nAgain, Charles Prosser is considered to be the architect of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, which sought federal funding to the state to advance precollegiate vocational education on agricultural and industrial studies in home economics (Knoll). Posser opposed the then-existing educational system that failed to recognize and nurture the fundamental differences in interests, aptitude, and occupational opportunities for young people. Posser observed that in the sixth grade, the student\'s interests and aptitude were shaped differently and that there was the need for developing vocational training programs that would take care of students\' technical training needs to enhance their opportunity to succeed in society. The Smith -Hughes Act of 1917 is the foundation of the current Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act, a manifestation of the influence of the progressive movement personality contribution to current educational legislatures (Knoll). \nIn addition, David Samuel Snedden\'s main contribution to the educational legislature was the detachment of educational legislation powers from the politicians, which was prevalent in the classical education movement era. Snedden observed that America\'s education of the late 18th century was inefficient and undemocratic (Knoll). The inefficiency perception concurs with Posser\'s claims that the then education system discriminated significantly, a majority of learners who were otherwise interested in different disciplines; particularly technical courses; that were of less concern at the time. Undemocratic nature, on the other hand, was based on the limited choices of students with regards to courses that could be pursued, as well as racial and gender discrimination.\nTherefore, the educational legislature in the United States has come a long way from the classical movement to the progressive movement. The later movement, which occurred in the late 19th and 20th centuries, focused on adjusting the educational system to incorporate more of the technical needs of the society; consider the various skills and capabilities of students other than college and scholarship. The progressive movement legislatures, philosophies, and policies continue to have a significant impact on the modern educational legislature, such as the CTE Act.\n\nWork Cited\nKnoll, Michael. “Charles Prosser (1871 – 1952).” State University.com, education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2338/Prosser-Charles-1871-1952.html.

Anita Scism was appointed to be the organization’s president in 1998 to succeed Mitchell. After assuming the position, Anita formed a new board to oversee the operations of the organization. The organization is facing some financial challenges that are have delayed some of its operation. The president and the board of directors are working on the strategies that can be adopted to solve the issue of financial shortages and enhance the success of the organization in all of its projects. The Walton Art Center has shown reputable progress of the past few years. However, the center has some challenges that need to be addressed before things get out of hand.  As the president, Anita Scism should come up with policies and strategies that boost positive growth of the center. Anita should use the strategic planning retreat as an avenue for developing mechanisms that can aid in boosting revenue generation for the center.   In essence, the retreat would serve as a level ground for the board of directors to share their ideas with the president and ensure that the long a long lasting solution on matters related to finance is found. To enhance inclusivity and accommodation of all Walton Arts Center stakeholders, I would reformulate the mission to read, “the home for nurturing talent, creativity and enhancing financial prosperity to artist.’ Such a mission is inspiring and attractive to corporate institutions that might be willing to partner with the center to improve the standards of living for people in the society. On top of reformulation of the mission, the center should employ a new strategy. This is because the societal needs keep changing thereby rendering some services offered by the center obsolete. In addition, the modern technology has revolutionized the arts industry and therefore a new strategy is necessary to ensure that the operations of the center match the technological and industrial needs. Organizations use different approaches to forecast the short and long term future. Some of the mechanisms used to predict the short-term and long-term future include investment policies, financial statements, economic policies, competition levels and many others. Investment policies aid in forecasting the position that an organization will occupy after a certain period of time. In essence, the investment policies of an organization determine its growth potential and its value in the market. Economic policies show how the economy is expected to behave in a given period and the corresponding consequences that arise due to manipulation of economic activities in a given industry. The financial statements portray the financial performance of an organization over a given time and aids in devising the means for expanding the business.  Lastly, the competition levels help in identifying whether an organization has the potential to bit other organizations that provide similar products or services in the market. A downturn in the economy has more adverse impacts on the non-profit organization compared to the profit organization. The non-profit organizations depend on donors and well-wishers for funds and other resources, unlike the profit organizations whose funds come from profitable business activities. In this regard, a downturn in the economy   lowers the number of donors and increases the running costs for non-profit organizations. In the case of profit organization, a downturn in the economy may present investment opportunities or avenues for developing new products lines thereby reducing financial losses. The Walton Art Center has devised a unique strategy to promote successive operation in its struggle to boost the welfare of art students. The organizations   adopt a business-level differentiation approach to conducting its business. For instance, retreats for the board of directors and rewarding artists who show proficient skills has aided in promoting a positive image of the organization. However, the organization need to eliminate activities that do not contribute direct to the development of arts. This would ensure that the available funds are used effectively and to the benefit of the appropriate persons. In addition, cutting down on expenses would increase the amount of funds available for the development of the organization. In essence, effective use of funds and other resources can aid in winning more donors and their solving the financial problems facing the organization. In summary, it is necessary for the organization to adopt effective strategies for sourcing funds to promote smooth running of activities.', 'Example: Children with Chronic Conditions Explanation of the study: The study is about children with disability and focuses on exploring the wishes of the parents who have children suffering from chronic illness (Wolman, Garwick & Blum, 2001). Type of the study:  retrospective since it is based on an already existing issue. Participants: They include community leaders, parents, chronically ill children, teachers and trained interviewers. Independent variable: chronic diseases Depend variable: children Confounding variable:  Treatment approach adopted. To control the confounding variable, I would amend the treat approach adopted to address the respective chronic conditions. QUESTION 2 r= .81, p<0.01 -indicates that there is a strong positive linear relationship between self-esteem and self-concept. In addition, the results show that there the correlation between self-esteem and self-control is different from zero. r= -.84, p<0.01 -The results portray that there exist a strong negative linear relationship between self-esteem and depression. Moreover, the correlation between the two variables is different from zero. r= .32, p=0.8 –The outcome shows that there is a moderate positive linear relationship between self-esteem and number of friends. However, the correlation between the two variables is not statistically significant. QUESTION 3 Example: A fitness instructor testing the effectiveness of performance-enhancing herbal supplements on students during exercises. Type of the study: The study is pre-experimental since there do not exist tested or verified results. Title: Efficiency of performance-enhancing herbal on trainees Participants: fitness trainees. Independent variable: performance of trainees. Dependent variable: performance enhancing herbal Confounding variable: nature of the exercise. To control the confounding variable, I would vary the intensity of the exercise. QUESTION 4 Study: The effects of chronic illnesses on human activities. The reason for using qualitative study: It is difficult to quantify the impact of chronic diseases on human activities. Title: “The Relationship between Human Activities and Chronic Illnesses”. Participants:  Health professional, patients and their relatives Questions: How do chronically ill patients relate with other? What are some contributions of chronically ill patients in the homestead? What do chronically ill patients enjoy doing most? Does a chronic condition have any impact on an individual’s activeness? QUESTION 5 The study is effective since some aspects of the research cannot be quantified. Some similarities between the qualitative studies are that focus on investigating unquantifiable variables in any given study and evaluate intangible factors. However, the difference is that they employ different approaches since the topics of study vary. Findings: The advancements in medical science and technology have increased the life expectancy of children with chronic illnesses. Over 50% of children with chronic conditions in America have access to special education. The qualitative study will attempt to find out how the improvements in medical science and technology influence the longevity of living for children with chronic conditions. In addition, the study will further evaluate the percentage of children with chronic conditions that has access to special education. Participants: Special education teachers and Medical professionals Title: The Welfare of Children with Chronic Conditions Question 1 is a casual comparative study since it focuses on determining the association between different variables.', 'The type of work setting that the paper is discussing is a hospital setting. A hospital setting in the context of this paper refers to a facility that has sufficient medical equipment and can provide adequate care for both outpatients and inpatients. Inter-professionals teams are present in the setting of interest since the facility handles various health issues that require specific experts in the field. The team function that could be improved in the setting is the communication between the nurses and the physicians since an enhanced communication between the two sets of professionals could help improve the quality of care provided by the facility. Compassion A nursing action that could contribute to compassion through interprofessional support is the situation whereby a nurse consults with experts on the health issue affecting a patient as a way of ensuring that the patient receives quality care. The action might have a positive impact on the culture of the organization as well as the patient’s outcome. For the culture of the organization, the compassionate action can lead to the development of a culture whereby the nurses take the full responsibility of ensuring that their patients receive the best care and are on course to full recovery. Concerning the patient’s outcome, the action can improve their willingness to continue with the care, leading to improved health results. Advocacy A nursing action that could contribute to advocacy through interprofessional support is the situation whereby a nurse engages other health professionals in the facility to seek a united front regarding the realization of particular reforms in healthcare (Sundqvist, Holmefur, Nilsson, & Anderzén-Carlsson, 2016). The action might impact the culture of the organization by leading the health professionals in the facility always to place the needs of the patients ahead. Further, it may impact the outcome of the patients by leading to the provision of quality care. Resilience A nursing action that could contribute to resilience through interprofessional support is the persistence towards ensuring that the patient receives the best available care by working with physicians to provide the best care for the patients even under stressful conditions. The resilient action might impact the facility’s culture by leading the workforce towards developing positive perceptions in caring for their patients even when under stress. Besides, the action might have a positive impact on the outcome of the patient by ensuring that they receive timely care. Evidence-Based Practice A nursing action that could contribute to evidence-based practice through interprofessional support is the practice of updating oneself with the best available methods for handling particular health issues and consulting with other professionals to improve one’s knowledge on the matter (Saunders & Vehviläinen-Julkunen, 2016). The action might lead the organization to develop a culture whereby the health professionals always seek the best available options for providing the best care to their patients. Further, the action can also have a positive impact on the patient’s outcome since they would be receiving the best-proven care. Summary iCARE components can support interprofessional teams and patient outcomes through nursing actions such as compassion, advocacy, resilience, and evidence-based practice, leading to the development of an organizational culture where all health professionals seek to achieve the best health result for their patients while the patients receive the best care available. I may influence the process of support for interprofessional teams on my organization by presenting the potential of using interprofessional units in improving care.', 'As consultant I have seen different companies in different industries and where all have differences. In every company the common denominator is that data driven decisions are getting more important every day in all levels of the organization. The fourth industrial revolution is in full progress and the volume and accessibility of data is ever growing. There are different changes occurring in organizations at high rates in organizations (Armenakis & Harris, 2009). The exact rate in which they are occurring cannot be determined however many changes are believed to cause or fail to deliver the executed organizational results (Shin, et al. 2012). Change is believed to either cause positive or negative impacts depending on the type of change. There is limited literature on research of how human organizational factors has shifted their focus on general openness or readiness to change while neglecting on assess individual’s commitment to the specific changes. When researching about the impact of change on both humans and non-living objects, data on non-living objects available and easy to interpret. However, for humans in the field of change in management and business, change becomes hard to interpret and quantify due to different variables and factors that come into account. Often, management always focuses on the necessity of the changes by putting into considerations the returns on investments. The focus of the management therefore is to sustain a thriving business. The problem is that the management might initiate a change but if the employees do not work towards achieving the objectives of the proposed change then there will be no noticeable return in the company’s investment. There is a need for management in an organization to creat a sense of urgency with the employees whenever they want to propose any aspect of change to make sure that each employee sees the significance for change. However, even when employees understand the need or are open to change, this does not always mean that the proposed change will be good for the company. There is therefore, a distinct difference in any individual’s aspect of change, their readiness for change and their commitment to any specific change. This paper therefore, reviews the use of the three-component model questionnaire to resolve and show commitment to organizational change. Research Objectives The objectives of this research are to first discuss commitment, organizational commitment and individual commitment to reach the three-component model; desire, need and obligation rated by Meyer and Allen (2002). Second the research will focus on validating and refining this model with the hope of it being used in future corporate changes to verify desired changes prior to implementation and hopefully increasing the success rate of change initiatives. Third, the research will review this model using field-proven experts to verify the model. Fourth, demonstrate how the three-component model helps in explaining the research findings on change and how the model can serve as a guide in future research to explain commitments in organizational settings. The three-component model has proven to be more than just a questionnaire to verify individuals’ commitment to change since each component is has a different implication on job behavior and they are developed as a function to different antecedents. This research therefore aims at reconceptualization and synthesis of the existing research on commitment to an organizational setting and to serve as a framework for any future or further research on commitment. The three-component model of Meyer & Allen (1990) and the extension of the model from Herscovitch & Meyer (2002) are the foundation of this research. The review based on experts is the main focus, but in the same time this research wants to use these experts to verify if focal and discretionary behavior shouldn’t be more apparent in the questionnaire to determine commitment to change. Discretionary behavior refers to employee behavior that promotes the employee’s efficiency and effectiveness in the functioning of an organization but is not explicitly or directly recognized by any formal reward system. Focal behavior on the other hand refers to employees behaving like an independent variable while the focus should be on the entire organization and all employees work should be strategized for the organization’s production and achieving the organizational goals. Background and overview of organizational commitment Measurement of organizational commitment has proven difficult to measure and interpret even with the accumulating amount of research the conceptualizing and measurement has become more diverse. The three-component model of commitment in organizational settings was created to argue the employee commitment to the company using three different components. The three components in the model respond to commitment in with three different psychological states. The three components of the model include, desire or affection which is drawn from affective commitment, need drawn from the continuance commitment or fear of loss and a sense of obligation which is drawn from normative commitment. The models aim is to maintain employment in a specific organization. Commitment to change is one the hardest variables in change to quantify  according to conducted research since to measure and conceptualize commitment one needs to understand the employee needs, desire and obligation and I believe that this is the reason it is not used in current management practices. This research will build on the three-component conceptualization of organizational commitment (Meyer and Allen, 1990) and the extension of the three-component model focusing on commitment to change specifically. (Herscovitch and Meyer, 2002). The goal of this research is to give management a workable measurement tool with a solid foundation to verify their proposed changes and give change a higher success rate. Defining commitment Commitment has been a broadly used term. In order to create our own definition of commitment specific for this research we start with several key definitions from previous research. In most academic research commitment has been used in relation to organizational commitment. Organizational commitment as defined by Mowday et. al (1979) “as the relative strength of an individual’s identification with and involvement in a particular organization” (Mowday et al. 1979: 226). (Meyer and Allen, 1991) described commitment as “commitment is a psychological state that characterizes the employee’s relationship with the organization, and has implications for the decision to continue or discontinue membership in the organization” (Meyer and Allen 1991, 67). Afterwards Meyer together with (Herscovitch, 2002) defined commitment to change “as a force (mind-set) that binds an individual to a course of action deemed necessary for the successful implementation of a change initiative” (Herscovitch and Meyer 2002, 475). This research wants to focus on the individuals’ commitment to a specific change as presented by the organization. Therefore, when speaking of commitment, the following definition is applicable. Commitment in an organization is always focused on the desires, needs and obligations of employees therefore, commitment can be considered as a mindset that characterizes the employees’ relationship with a particular change in the organization and the views of where the proposed action is necessary for the successful implementation of that specific change initiative. The Three-Component Model Literature describes two styles of commitment, behavioral and attitudinal. “Attitudinal commitment focuses on the process by which people come to think about their relationship with the organization” (Mowday, et al. 1982: 26). The conditions the organization presents the individual with create a psychological state of the individual which influences his behavior. “Behavioral commitment, on the other hand, relates to the process by which individuals become locked into a certain organization and how they deal with this problem” (Mowday, et al. 1982: 26). Behavior measured using the three-component model shows an employer’s commitment to the company, and the employers action towards the change leads to a type of behavior and a psychological state that effects future behavior. These two types of commitment were then conceptualized by Meyer and Allen in 1991 regarding organizational commitment creating affective, continuance and normative commitment (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Affective commitment being the attachment to the organization (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Continuance commitment refers to the perception an individual has of the costs involved should her or she leave (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Normative commitment refers to the perception the individual has that he should be loyal and should show certain behavior (Meyer & Allen, 1991). This is conceptualized for organizational commitment. In order to be useful for commitment to a specific change Herscovitch and Meyer extended this view in 2002. Affective commitment was extended to “a desire to provide support for the change based on a belief in its inherent benefits” (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002, 475). Continuance commitment into “a recognition that there are costs associated with failure to provide support for the change” (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002: 475). Normative commitment into “a sense of obligation to provide support for the change” (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002: 475).  (normative commitment to change). That Affective commitment is described as “the desire to remain” (Herscovitch and Meyer 2002, 475). With these additions Herscovitch & Meyer created the foundation for the concepts to measure individual commitment to change. These three concepts of commitment, lead to a simplified model as shown below. Figure 1, Summary model of Meyer & Allen (1991) The three component model comprises of three types of commitment: affective, continuance and normative. The three types of commitment combined together makes an employee to be committed to proposed change in an organization as written in Meyer & Allen (1991). Herscovitch & Meyer (2001) affection, continuance and normative commitments are believed to lead to Focal and Discretionary behavior. Focal and Discretionary behavior Focal behavior is everything a person does or does not do by on their own during the person’s commitment to the organization. The behavior relates most to the normative commitment, since focal behavior is mostly relatable to the employee’s reason to want to stay in a specific organization (Herscovitch and Meyer 2002). You can tell a person to change, but to ensure long term change you need to change behavior. Focal behavior is based on an employee independent action towards their desire to ensure they stay at the organization therefore, the behavior is not mandated by the explicit organizations rules on their labor contract but exclusively on the employee decision to undertake the change. Herscovitch and Meyer (2002) refer to this as Compliance. Discretionary behavior is everything a person wants to do that is not necessary, going the extra mile (Herscovitch & Meyer 2002). Herscovitch and Meyer (2002) refer to two different subtypes of Discretionary behavior. In an instance where the employer does little sacrifices on their journey towards a specific change, it means that his or her actions are in line with the concept of the change. The other type is championing, this requires more sacrifice of the individual and helps to promote the values of the change and the organization extend to fellow employees. The term championing is also found in other management literature, to nurture and advocate as a part of the different roles’ management plays (Floyd, 2000). I believe that focal behavior is the result of a well implemented change and discretionary behavior is necessary to create change. From this all we can say that affective, normative and continuance commitment give a commitment for change. Commitment for Change should lead to focal and discretionary behavior. Measuring the promise or the idea of this behavior will give management a new insight in whether the employees agree with the coming change or not. Adding focal and discretionary behavior in the framework gives us the possibility to also look at acted behavior rather than only intentions or thoughts. The Three-Component Model Questionnaire Review The research done by Herscovitch and Meyer in 2002 created a questionnaire, see appendix 1, by them and afterwards tested on several groups to validate theories. This study will attempt to review the three-component model using research studies on the topic in relation to organizational commitment as well as involve a process to verify if the questionnaire is complete. It is now widely accepted that employee commitment to organizations can take different forms and the moment we acknowledge the differences; researchers will be more precise in predicting the employee’s commitment behavior to the organization. It is possible for an employee to experience the three components of the model simultaneously having all the three mind-sets all together this however will still depend on the employee commitment to the organization. Together, the three components reflect on the employee’s commitment profile although the three of them reduce the likelihood that an employee will leave an organization perhaps the questionnaires in the three components can distinguish each employee’s individual implication on their on-job behavior. The three component-model questionnaires can affect the employees on-job behavior in three ways; first, the employee that desire to attend work regularly always perform their tasks to the best of their ability but they do very little to help out with extra tasks. Second, employees who remain with their sense of obligation are likely are obligated as long as they see tasks as part of their duty or a means to reciprocate the benefits they get from the organization. Third, employees who remain based of their needs are more likely to perform tasks that are a little more than what is required of them to ensure that they maintain their position in the organization and also avoid losing their employment. Results Herscovitch and Meyer in 2002 empirical research on creating the questionnaire provides support for the three components of the model together with methods of predicting the differential behavioral implications for the three types of commitments; normative, continuance, and affective. One prediction of Herscovitch and Meyer in 2002 is that the strength of the strength of relation between each component of commitment and the components relevant behavior is greater when the other components are weaker rather than when they are strong. The reason for this prediction is that when other commitments are strong then the relatable behavior will occur even when the commitment of interest is weak thereby, the questionnaires on the three-component model attenuate the correlation between behavior and the commitment of interest. For instance, this is true for the case of focal behavior where by definition one of the three components of the model are sufficient to produce the desired behavior in relation to commitment. The hypothesis in this case is that the aspect of change in relation between to any of each component of commitment in the three-component model in compliance would be stronger. Second prediction made by Meyer and Herscovitch (2002) concerned the probability in which an employee with different kind of commitment profiles can engage in focal and discretionary behavior. The authors used the questionnaires to argue that as long as one form of commitment is stronger than all the other two there is a high probability that the employees would engage in focal behavior. In comparison, the probability that employees might engage in discretionary behavior is low when related with only continuance commitment and relatively high when related with only affective commitment. Additionally, since continuance commitment involves a sense of awareness of constraints on behavior, using the questionnaires Meyer and Herscovitch (2002) argued that the potential positive impact of strong affective commitment can be weakened when the commitment is combined with a strong continuance commitment. For normative commitment, although it is expected to increase the probability that an employee will engage themselves with discretionary behavior, the authors concluded that the probability might not be necessary great as compared to when affective commitment is strong since in the case of normative commitment some aspects such as costs and obligations can be viewed as part of the constraints. Conclusion In conclusion, the results when using Meyer and Herscovitch’s (2002) questionnaires on the three-component module fairly support the predictions the model is supposed to produce. Most notably, generalizing the three components model to study the employee’s commitment to organizational change would produce these changes; first, the three components of commitment in relation to the aspect of change can be distinguishable from the components of organizational commitment which include need, desire and obligation. Second, commitment to employee’s change can contribute over and above in the organizational commitment and aid in predicting the employee self-reported behavioral patterns in support to the changes made by the organization. Third, all the three commitments work correlatedly with each other to produce a positive compliance to change putting into considerations the employee’s requirements, but only normative commitment and affective commitment correlate positively when the organization taps into championship and cooperation patterns displayed by their employees. Fourth, the prediction of focal and discretionary behavior can be improved by considering the interactive and addictive effects caused by the three components of commitments and most notably using continuance ad affective commitment.', 'Using the news article will see one understanding the objective and the facts. They ensure that the objective of the topic together with the facts are well presented. PR, on the other hand, requires that the audience is able to support the topic being discussed. They ensure that enough facts have been presented subjectively to motivate the audience into offering their support. PR is changing due to use of social media. Several news outlets are created through social media hence reach a larger audience. To be successful in PR, research is very important and one needs enough knowledge about the subject being presented. Research ensures that PR professionals explain extensively on the topic and are able to draw a larger audience. An example is the Handguns in America case study. It shows how first information can be shared through social media. Several campaigns were launched through social media looking for the support of the audience. They ensured that the topic presented was subjective enough to capture the attention of the audience and get them to offer the necessary support. All the posts ensure that they have initiated the necessary fight for America to help in controlling gun ownership. However, the campaigns as presented by Brady indicates that they are not doing enough to prove their views and fight on gun control. They haven’t provided the necessary objectives which can indicate the reasons as to why they have put up such a campaign. First impressions are very important and having objectives as the first opening of the topic can be very beneficial to any campaign. As compared to new article, this shows that the PR article used by Brady campaigns is just sitting there entirely depending on the support which can be achieved from the audience.', 'Assessment of the company’s financial viability should incorporate factors like the scale of the business, scope and the relative risks involved in the proposed project. When assessing the financial sustainability of a business entity, it is important for the investors to take care of factors like level of complexity of the firm (Ting-Peng, Chen-Wei, Yeh & Lin, 2007). Projects requiring lengthy and complex procedures for example projects with extended payroll services or even centralized IT services; such projects have relatively higher risk than projects that use simple procurement process. To some great extent, more complex projects with a high value attached to them are usually very viable projects and thus they are subjected to risk management process which involves looking at the need and the scope of the financial viability of the project (Snowdon & Stonehouse, 2006). Other factors to consider when assessing the financial sustainability of a business entity to invest in are like economic factors like inflation rates, the level of competition, the market share of the company, profit margins of a particular industry among many other factors. This paper seeks to analyze Samsung and Nokia companies regarding their financial liabilities to determine which company is worth investing much money as an investor.\nExplanation of keywords\nA model in the business context represents various core value aspects of a business entity that incorporates business purpose, strategies, the organizational structure of business, trade policies among other areas of the firm. In basic terms, a business model is a tool or a method of conducting business through which a business organization can sustain itself in the market\nStrategies refer to business development methods that an entity may use to gain a competitive edge over its rivals in the market they involve marketing, management, production and many other business techniques (Bouwman, Zhengjia & Limonard, 2008).\nBusiness process model refers to the various systems in the mobile phone industry that defines and represent business operations of an organization aimed at improving the current business situation. The business process involves the collection of various interrelated and well-structured business activities that are intended to producing a particular product for a certain group of customers (Hakansson & Ford, 2002).\nAnalysis of the two mobile phone companies (Nokia and Samsung Companies)\nNokia Company\nThe company of Nokia has its origin from Finland and over the time, it has been operating from its headquarters in Espoo as one of the leading information and Technology Company (Luke, Verreynne & Kearins, 2007). It is one of the largest vendors of mobile phones following companies like Samsung Company. However, the market share of Nokia has been going down following the introduction of smartphones like Apple, galaxy among many other touch screen smartphones from other mobile phone vendors like Samsung.\nRegarding marketing strategies, Nokia Company has diversified its customers through its well-planned marketing strategies around the global markets (Khanna, 2011). Nokia products are used widely by both low-income earners and even the high-income earners living both in towns and even rural setups because of the right method of standardizing its products within the industry. The company of Nokia tends to standardize and even customize its products when needed following the fact that markets for cellular phone products are going through various growth stages. Nokia Company is using aggressive marketing strategies in around the international markets and therefore has been increasing become very competitive in the global markets (Seccareccia, 2014). The company has been increasing its sales through its all markets following its strong positioning strategies, competitive pricing strategies and even through its excellent promotional activities.\nSamsung Company\nSamsung Electronics is one of the world’s leading companies manufacturing a wide array of consumer electronics, home appliances, IT products and many other telecommunication infrastructural devices. The company also produces components like LED and LCD panels, flash memories, storage and fiber optic devices and many other electronic accessories. Samsung Company is also the world leader in terms manufacturing mobile phones, smartphones and it is the largest provider of tablet computers . Other than providing electronic appliances, Samsung Company has also played a bigger role in offering a broad range of solutions to other sectors like education health care and even finance sectors. Through its many subsidiaries, Samsung Company operates in very many countries around the world namely America, Africa, Europe and many other nations in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.\nSamsung Company has managed of time to establish several mobile phone subsidiaries so as to increase of its brand promotional methods throughout the global markets. Providing advanced technology products and the ability of the company to position itself on various technology platforms will greatly help the company to some great extent in marketing its products to different groups of customers (Khanna, 2011). The company has adopted several techniques in marketing its products for example advertisement, celebrity endorsement among many other marketing techniques.\nMarketing techniques used by Nokia\nPricing\nRegarding pricing of goods, the pricing strategies used by Nokia Company varies from day to day and from situation to situation and from one product to another (Calia, 2012). For products that are cutting through different edges of technologies and are newly introduced into the market,      \nPromotion \nCompany uses skimming marketing technique which is followed by a price reduction of the products. The cost-effective commodities of the company that is more focused on the economic situation of different markets, the company tends to use penetrating pricing strategies to reach out to its customers.\nPlace\nThe distribution network of Nokia Company is localized in very many countries close to 150 countries, and the company tends to use aggressive marketing strategy to reach out to all its customers in those countries.\nProduct\nMarketing efforts of Nokia Company are mainly focused on enhancing manufacturing of Nokia handsets only, and it is boosting its product portfolio only through investing in new market models.\nSamsung Company, on the other hand, has its presence in various product categories thus over time; the company has been forced to put into action different pricing strategies (Daft, 2016). The products of Samsung Company, for example, its smartphones are some of the best around the world and therefore the company of Samsung serves as a market leader when it comes to the product features and the USP’s they offer to their customers.\nPricing \nSamsung Company for a very long time users skimming price for most of its products as it works to get high value for its customers before competitors catch up with it in the market (Snowdon & Stonehouse, 2006). In case the model becomes worn out (old) or is launched by any other market competitor, the company decides to drop the prices of such products to outcompete favorably in the industry.\nPlace\nThe presence of Samsung Company is felt through very many channels of global markets as it operates through various marketing channel concepts like modern retail and distributors, sales and service dealers among many other market channels. Most of the dealers who are involved in the sales and service operations of the company handle key accounting issues for the company and sometimes, they involve themselves in corporate sales (Williams & Martinez, 2014).\nPromotion \nRegarding promotion, the company of Samsung uses various promotion techniques as it believes on pulling and attracting customers to themselves through various sales promotion methods like an advertisement, after sale services, product promotion among many other marketing techniques.\nProducts \nOn different market segments and the company’ brand image, Samsung Company has several options that are available especially to top-end smartphone market segment with popular products like Samsung Galaxy 5, Samsung Wave Series and even Samsung Focus. For the case of Nokia, it has only one brand product called Nokia N8 that has been widely criticized for its common software that for many viewers are outdated. Samsung for a very long time has won myriads of accolades from the general public and even among the critics following its wide range top-end products like smartphones (Williams& Martinez, 2014).\nRecommendations\nWhen assessing the financial sustainability of a business entity, it is important for the investors to take care of factors like level of complexity of the business operations of the company (Bleuel & Stanley, 2007). Companies with relatively lengthy and complex procedures for example Nokia Company with extended payroll services or even centralized IT services are characterized higher risk than projects that use simple procurement process like Samsung Company (Laitinen, 2011).\nInvesting in Samsung Company is worthwhile and may make one realize his or her value for money as compared to Nokia this is because Samsung has a relatively wider market share, excellent financial management skills and above all good customer base (Hakansson & Ford, 2002). The Samsung Company has done a great job through the provision of the technical support that has helped in the creation of the customer loyalty for the products of the company. Samsung Company has maintained its productivity for a long time without ever making down any of their products, and as a result, they gain a significant market share with low prices of the products. This market attribute is very much important for the companies like Samsung because it allows them to devise methods to outcompete most of its principal market rivals like Nokia and many others who are also involved in the stiff market competition with Samsung Company (Rochford, 2010). Because of industry rivalry, Samsung cannot take its position in the market for granted since many other companies are coming up into the market thus creating an intense competition. Samsung Company has tried to put measures that will help to meet the expectations of their customers so that they can achieve the majority of the market share through different segments that are based on the level of education, age and the income standards of the customers.\nWhen more companies enter the market, then it means that the market share for the Samsung Company is reduced. The company can maintain its market shares and even generate more profits through establishing strong market strategies through measures like differentiating its products and brands (Mulla, 2003). Differentiation makes a bit difficult for the new companies to compete companies like Samsung in the market since they have established a strong Image brand and even perceived excellent customer service and value. Markets for the white goods are highly saturated with many substitutes. Therefore, it is important for companies like Samsung to take due precautions when deciding on the appropriate marketing strategies. Because of the substitute threats in most of the global markets, Samsung Company may be forced to adopt differential pricing so as to attract most of the consumers from different income pyramids to wean them completely from the cheaper substitutes (Ligthelm, 2012).\nRegarding low-cost strategy, Samsung Company should provide its products and services at a relatively lower price compared to its key market rivals; this will enable the company to attract new customers following the fact that most of the consumers are more sensitive to price changes. For many of the customers, Samsung brands are unique and are of higher quality thus they have unique benefits over the competition, and therefore customers are willing to purchase those products despite the price changes.\nConclusion\nOver the last few years, the mobile phone industry has witnessed a tremendous change with upcoming of several unbelievable products into the industry. Samsung Company has established itself in various markets through its many subsidiaries to increase the visibility of its brand promotion. Samsung has adopted various marketing strategies to ensure that it optimizes its sales volume and as a result increasing its profit margins. To achieve this successfully, Samsung has opted to use several promotional techniques to reach out to many customers in various global markets for example corporate advertisement, celebrity endorsement among many other technologies. Following the fact that popularity of Nokia Company as compared to that of Samsung Company is quite scarce, Samsung Company has gained a competitive advantage over Nokia this is partly because of the popularity of Samsung’s products among the teenagers and even old persons. Secondly, Samsung Company has continued to tailor its strategies to follow the needs and requirements of the target markets thereby increasing its chances of succeeding in the industry than Nokia Company thus it is worth investing in Samsung than Nokia.', 'A person has to experience emotions as well as stressful situations and conflicting circumstances since they are  human.  The three key challenges of life are outlined as ethical conflicts, personal battles for meaning,  and the unavoidable chaotic nature of our world that humans face.  In Hamlet, William Shakespeare presents  a complex analysis of the human condition through the prince Hamlet as the central character who performs an analysis  of his self and fights inner turmoil to discover deep-seated aspects of human nature.  To characterize  his emotional torment and reveal the essence of human nature, Shakespeare creates the character of Hamlet to embody  the human nature of fundamental existential conflicts and moral grey area and develops him through detailed characterization and poetic  language. Analysis: The Inner Thoughts of Hamlet  The above case shows that Shakespeare used characterization to create  a very complicated and full-bodied Hamlet. At the beginning of the play Hamlet is overwhelmed by  the loss of his father and the betrayal of his mother Gertrude who has married Hamlet’s  uncle Claudius. In his first soliloquy Hamlet is seen as a desperate and suicidal  individual and at the same time as a man who has lost his mind and is unable to decide what  to do, in his speech “O, that this too too solid flesh would melt”  (1.2.129). His hesitation between doing something and doing nothing is also visible in his long thinking  in “Whether ’tis better to have got or to be”  (3.1.56) which also shows his internal battle. In this case, Shakespeare is able to depict the inner feelings  of man and the struggle that is encountered in arriving at a right decision, especially when the situation is  ethically gray. Figurative Language: The Influence of Symbolism and Metaphor Using metaphors and symbolism enables Shakespeare to deepen the intricate nature of Hamlets character in his work.  The unstable state of Denmark manifests morally in both the nations downslide and Hamlets perception of decay throughout the realm.  The kingdom suffers from massive dishonesty together with corruption because Hamlet declares, "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark" (1.4.90).  Through the garden metaphor Hamlet portrays his despondency by describing the world as an untended space (1.2.135).  The images demonstrate a connection between Hamlets thoughts about the world and his psychological suffering through visual representation of his mental processes. In the core narrative runs an ongoing conflict about acting versus sitting still. A central theme of Hamlet follows the universal conflict between taking action versus sitting still which characterizes the experiences of human beings.  Throughout the entire play Hamlet questions if he should trust his conflicting feelings while also seeking vengeance for his fathers murder.  His hesitancy emerges from both philosophical thoughts and ethical considerations particularly focusing on the outcomes of his actions.  During Claudius prayer Hamlet shows his unwillingness to kill because he says “A villain kills my father, and for that / I, his sole son, do this same villain send / To heaven” (3.3.76-78). The prospect of murdering Claudius sends him to heaven in his opinion.  The manifestation of Hamlets mental block between morality and philosophy occurs in this scene while illustrating the universal human experience of dealing with tough ethical decisions. Conclusion Using characters and symbolic storytelling in his theatrical work Hamlet the author Shakespeare reveals human dramatic situations. Through his presentation of Hamlet the audience learns about three fundamental humanities principles as the protagonist battles his emotional destruction and strives to understand death. The playwright Shakespeare constructs a thorough investigation of human psychology through his application of symbolic imagery and metaphoric elements. Throughout history people have continuously formed their identity profiles during times of unexpected occurrence according to this narrative.', 'Heraclitus believed in the perpetual change as he evokes the image of flowing water where he states that “you cannot step into the same river twice”. As per his idea of flowing water, he explained that “everything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing stays fixed” which means that everything that exists changes (Palmer, 2012). Heraclitus believed in a change of things as he states that “there is an exchange of all things for fire and of fire for all things.” By this, he meant that the form of the flame is stable but in the flame, everything changes thus his belief that everything changes. On the other hand, Parmenides believed that there is no change and the world stands still (Palmer, 2012). He argues that motion is impossible since motion involves being going from where being is to where being is not. According to his argument, Parmenides views are that nothing changes in reality.  He proves that nothing changes by arguing that being is rational that only what can be thought can exist and since “nothing” cannot be thought without thinking of it as something then there is no nothing, there is only being (Palmer, 2012). With this idea, he concludes that being is uncreated since if it is created it would have been created from nothing, but there is no nothing thus there is no change in the world. Acceptance of philosophical claims of Heraclitus has some practical consequences in that lead to acceptance of the changes that are there in the world, for instance, death, birth, sickness among others. On the other hand, accepting the philosophical claims of Parmenides will have practical consequences of the denial to accept change. Believing in Parmenides will always lead to a life of denial.', 'Qualitative studies are always subject to criticism on their validity, reliability, and generalizability, based on the philosophical assumptions on which they are grounded (Hayashi et al., 2019). Criticism of qualitative researches is based on the potential bias of the researcher in analyzing and interpreting the data to suit the expected outcomes. Validity is, therefore, a major concern in qualitative design, and the following factors are usually considered in increasing the validity of a research study.\nAccording to Rose and Johnson (2020), the specific research design, sample size, and data analysis are crucial determinants of validity in qualitative researchers. Validity can be increased by ensuring the researcher selects the most appropriate design to obtain appropriate data, analyze and interpret. To further explain the mentioned determinants of validity in qualitative studies, a study by Lemon et al. (2020) is used. The study is qualitative in nature, and the specific research design is phenomenological study, which obtains data from the lived experience of the participants. The purpose of the study was to explore the experience of Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT) doctorate graduates. The researchers’ selection of phenomenological study increases validity because the data is obtained from participants who have had the actual experience of studying MFT at the doctorate level and graduated. The study also used 9 participants, which also increases validity because the expectation is that the experience among MFT doctorate graduates is not significantly different. The sample size is, therefore, adequately representative. A thematic analysis approach was used, which is essentially the standard practice for analyzing primary qualitative studies. The analysis is, however, a major source of bias. Lemon et al. (2020), however, used the Researcher as Instrument Statement (RAIS) to document their self-thought, perception, experience, and opinion about the topic to ensure that the outcomes were not influenced or did not intersect with the findings from the analysis. This method was used to enhance the objectiveness of the researcher in analysis and interpretation.', "The effectiveness of the police purpose in accomplishing their duty has been measured by more than conviction of criminals, and apprehension and repression of criminal activities since the American democracy. The purpose of the American police is defined as the protection of property, life, and liberty of the American people. The American police have the duty of ensuring convenient, peaceful, and pleasant life for all the people, this is according to the American law. Centuries ago policing systems were convenient to the American people. However, in the modern world, the policing system is not adequate to meet the current needs. Multiple local police agencies that had overlapping jurisdiction and responsibility duplication were among the systems that were poorly adopted by the police in dealing with local crimes (Stevenson, 2008). The old policing systems have proved to be ineffective in coping with the crimes which extend beyond local jurisdiction. Due to the changing nature of the social conditions, which were becoming more complex, the police problems have increased. In the 21st-century, there has been fluctuation in volume, severity, and nature of crimes (Steverson, 2008). Therefore, the American police have increased their effectiveness by improving their policing systems. Because of the urge to increase police effectiveness, policing systems have grown more complex. The current policing systems are characterized by increased duplication of responsibilities and overlapping jurisdiction. Part 2 Crime rates- crime rates along with crime severity index is among the most traditional and oldest measures of success of the police. The argument behind the usage of this method is that usage of crime rates as a measure of success reflects the belief that the primary tasks of the police are to reduce crime (Reisig, 2007). Therefore, reduction in crime rate shows that the police are doing good work. This method is useful in rewarding the police and ensuring that the police were vigilant in their work. Arrest numbers and fines issued- this was used a measure of performance because enforcing of law by issuing fines and arresting criminals is a primary outcome of police work (Reisig, 2007). The useful bit of this method of measurement is that the police heads can know the insecure regions and they can deploy more officers. Clearance rate- this involves the measurement of the proportion of crimes that are solved by the police jurisdiction at a particular time (Reisig, 2007). This indicator shows the efficiency of the police in countering crime in their specific areas Call for service response time- this traditional method of police effectiveness measurement is not as popular as the methods above since it has been prone to various errors (Reisig, 2007). However, this method has been useful in setting up police stations to make the police response time to crime more efficient. Part 3 A few decades ago firefighting was seen as a blue collar job. In many areas, there was increased reliance on volunteers to provide fire protection. However, with the increased incidences of fire outbreaks and the growing population, there have been fewer people who have been willing to contribute to this noble course (Fire Fighting. Bureau of Workers' Compensation, Division of Safety and Hygiene, 2004). Due to the growth in demand for service, there have been firefighting institutions where people are trained on professional ways of handling fire incidences Today, there are many effective firefighters because firefighting has become a profession hence they should meet high standards training. Nowadays, firefighters are not just a group of people who are trained to suppress fire incidences and provide first aid services, but they have also become a provider of choice for prompt medical and emergency services.", '\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow I Plan to Prepare for the Final Exam and NCLEX\nName\nInstitutional Affiliation\nInstructor\nCourse\nDate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow I Plan to Prepare for the Final Exam and NCLEX\nExams are essential in determining if learners have a good grasp of concepts and course materials and can present answers in the most valuable form. The exam period can be stressful to a student; however, with successful preparation techniques, one confidently handle any exam. One of the techniques I plan to use to prepare for the exam is creating a study schedule. I will create a schedule of balanced activities, including time for a break, eat, sleep, socialize and study each subject. Another technique I plan to use is utilizing the resources available to me. If I have questions, I will reach out to my professor or tutor to give me ideas. Also, I will create study groups with my classmates to learn the course materials together. Lastly, since final exams and NCLEX can be stressful, I plan to take good care of my health. I will exercise regularly, eat healthy food and maintain a regular sleep pattern to clear my mind and feel mentally sharp. ', 'Typically, individuals with disabilities are one of the minority groups within the United States. Throughout history, they were among the groups of millions of people who did not have access to things that a majority of the citizens have access to including schools, public transport, and apartment accommodation. Under the state laws, the disabled did not have rights while others were committed to institutions in which they suffered from neglect. \nThe film\nThe occurrence of the World War II led to a change in above status after a number of people who wanted to live and enjoy their lives just like every other individual came up. This was with the aim of liberating all the Americans who had various disabilities from their limitations, which the government at the time was not willing to accommodate. In light of this, the film Lives Worth Living highlights the crucial development of the pioneers of this period who came to the realization that they needed to come together in order to change the world`s opinion regarding their fate. By a series of demonstrations and battles through legislation, the community on disability managed to secure equal rights of a civil nature for every person with a disability. Because of their efforts, many people`s lives were transformed. \nDirected by Eric Neudel and Released in 2011, the film Lives worth Living is based on an oral history described by the mythical heroes and richly illustrated by use of archived footage.  The film’s story is about Fred Fay who suffered a life-changing spinal cord injury in 1961, while at the tender age of 17 and refused to stick to the sidelines simply because he could not walk. He tirelessly fought for access, equal rights and opportunities for the disabled. This included advocating for a variety of programs, which allowed the disabled to live on their own. He died on 20th August 2011, and the film is a dedication to his life and efforts. The film also features Ed Roberts, who was the pioneer of the Berkeley independent living movement and is regarded as a father of the rights movement for the disabled.\nThe film echoes Martin Luther King`s march in Selma, where disabled protestors leave their wheelchairs and courageously drag themselves through steps leading to the courthouse. On the other hand, we can see activists who have quadriplegia maneuvering their wheelchairs in front of public buses, which are not fitted to accommodate them.  The film concludes with the fight for the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is one of the crucial civil rights legislative pieces, in the history of America. A large number of people who came together in solidarity to change the laws and attitudes showed clearly the importance of human power, self-determination, and cooperation. This was a demonstration that against all the odds, something worthwhile is easy to accomplish when people stand together. The film’s scenes illustrate active participation by disabled people. They are a demonstration of the effort and importance of the recognition of rights for the group. The protests including marching in front of buses that do not accommodate their condition is a clear show of their anger in their non-recognition simply because of their condition. It was a way of showing that things needed to change for the better. Society ostracised the disabled for a long time and time came when they sought recognition as citizens who needed protection too. \nADA\nEnacted into law in the year 1990, ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) is a civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on disabled individuals in all spheres of life, from the job environment to schools and transportation sector. The law also prohibits discrimination in all private and public places, which are open to the public at large. Mainly, the law ensures that disabled people have equal right and opportunities to every other individual. The ADA includes five sections, which have a basis in different sectors of public life. They include:\nTitle I- Employment.\nTitle II- Public Services: State and Local Government.\nTitle III- Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities.\nTitle IV- Telecommunications.\nTitle V- Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\nPhotos: illustrating ADA movement \nHow the film connect to GS 420 class content\nThe GS 420 has the end goal to develop competencies by getting to understand the experiences of disability and how to interact well with people encumbered by disabilities. The film puts us in a position where we get to place ourselves in the shoes of the disabled individuals. In the film, the disabled individuals left their own wheelchairs and crawled up the courthouse steps. Some of them chained their wheelchairs together, and this created a very powerful impression. That of vision, the collective power of the masses, and one of protest against the injustice that was apparent within the disabled community. It was a clear demand for justice and equality for the disabled people.', 'Management portfolio is a complex practice that involves decision-making on investment mix, aligning investments to objectives and managing risks among other (Sultana, 2012). Fortunes Inc is an example of enterprises that operate a portfolio of activities and maintain good performance.  Fortunes Inc has a unique management style that gives shareholders equal power when it comes to decision making. The cooperative has shown reputable performance for the last ten years. The good performance has attracted many investors from different sectors of the economy. Moreover, the good performance has aided the cooperative in securing different sources of funds for development and expansion. The core objectives for Fortunes Inc include maximization of shareholders returns and expansion of investment opportunities. The cooperative has expounded its investment to incorporate the banking sector and the capital market. Furthermore, the company has increased its investment in shares and other opportunities to enhance diversity as far as revenue generation is concerned.  The financial performance for the last two years shows that the cooperative’s financial position has improved. The improvement of the financial position is an attestation that the investment strategies of the company are effective (Blommestein et al., 2008). Fortunes Inc investment objective is to safeguard the shareholders financial position throughout its life. In this regard, it can be observed that the already established investment strategies support the objective and the cooperative has great potential for future growth. However, the fact that almost a half of the employees have less than twenty years to retirement is a big challenge to Fortune Inc. Essentially, the retirement of employees who have worked for several years is likely to lower the quality of the human resource (Iverson, 2013). Additionally, the process of recruiting new employees is costly. In this regard, the cooperative should retain all the workers to avoid the costs and inconveniences caused by recruitment of new workers. Recommendations and justifications on the appropriate objectives based on age and sustainable remuneration A well-developed pensions plan is important to any cooperative. A pensions plan serves as a source of motivation to workers since they are assured of financial stability at old age. The pension requirement for Fortunes Inc is quite complex and presents some challenges that might terminate its operation. The majority of trustees are set to retire in less than twenty years to come. In this regard, the cooperative may face financial hardships since the present provisions for pension are too expensive to manage if a large number of workers retire at the same time. Therefore, it is imperative for Fortunes Inc to establish effective measures to avert the danger of a financial crisis in future. Fortunes inc should concentrate on developing the existing investments to ensure regular revenue inflows. The pension scheme is quite expensive and for it to work efficiently enormous funding is required. It is worth noting that it is unprofessional to fund a pension scheme by loan since the interest on loan and other technicalities associated with borrowing leaves an enterprise with huge debts that may be difficult to pay. Therefore, it is necessary for Fortunes Inc to work on its investment policies to ensure that the pension scheme is funded by returns from the various investments. The age factor is an important factor to consider when designing the strategies to finance the pension scheme.  Over three-quarters of Fortunes Inc workers are to retire within 20 years from now, and this shows that a significant amount of money is required to cover for pensions. Therefore, the cooperative should establish a task force to formulate the mechanisms to be adopted to ensure that the age difference of workers is used to the advantage of the enterprise (Iverson, 2013). Analysis of the existing portfolio and recommendation for improvement Each member of the cooperative is set to receive one 60th of their final salary and a certain fixed salary.  This shows that the cooperative expects huge cash outflows in the near future. An analysis of the existing portfolio reveals that a big challenge awaits Fortunes Inc is appropriate strategies are not developed to avert the danger. Essentially, the yearly spending on pension is projected to increase from £45,000 in 2018 to £24, 2693. The existing portfolio of the cooperative cannot be able to cover the yearly expenses on pension payment for the next twenty years. If the cooperative continues with its existing portfolio, it is likely to suffer a shortfall almost every year. A shortfall translates that members must seek alternative means of financing the pension scheme since the cooperative resources are insufficient to provide financial security for retiring members.  Therefore, it is important for the members to invest in a new portfolio so as to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing portfolio. Investing in a new portfolio is an important strategy for the Fortunes Inc. The new portfolio is capable of addressing the shortfalls experienced when following the existing portfolio. In essence, the new portfolio is projected to increase the surplus from £75, 390 in 2016 to £109, 767 in 2036 as shown in the appendixes. In this regard, adoption of a new portfolio is of great significant to the company. Apparently, with the new portfolio, the cooperative will be able to fund the pension scheme fully and use the surplus for general development.  A surplus promises financial security and high investment potential and this aids in attracting investors and financial providers. Fortunes Inc should concentrate on developing a more efficient portfolio to avoid shortfall that might interrupt normal operations. Risk management According to Poitras, G. (2002), risk management is a comprehensive practice that involves risk identification, assessment and devising the strategies to mitigate, avoid or eliminate risk. The Fortunes Inc is faced with several risks that the members should consider when planning the day to day activities. Some of the risks that Fortunes Inc faces include liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, strategic risk and market risk among others. The various types of risks facing Fortunes Inc must be addressed appropriately to enhance smooth running of the cooperative activities. Apparently, failure to address risks might result in the collapse of the cooperative and cause huge financial loss to members. Risk metrics Investment risk can be defined as the deviation from a projected outcome. Organization that are involved in the management of investment portfolios are exposed to numerous risk that require proficient management. To enhance efficient risk management, both the absolute and relative mechanisms should be applied in the measurement of risks.  One of the commonest absolute risk metrics that can be adopted in risk management is the standard deviation. It is imperative to identify that standard deviation is a statistical measure of dispersion that provides an explanation to what happens in the investment world over a given period. Unsystematic risk refer to the uncertainty that faces an organisation due to the industry or company of investment. Studies show that unsystematic risk can result in adverse consequence of not addressed appropriately. The Unsystematic risks are managed through diversification so that the impact of loss is maintained at the lowest level possible.  An example of unsystematic risk can be observed in a situation where news that may negatively influence the return on investment of a firm affect a specific small number of investment options.   On the other hand, systematic risk refers to uncertainties derived from the entire market or industry.  In essence, systematic risks involve the period changes in stock prices that are caused by changes in the economy such as recession and interest rate. Systematic risk can be managed through hedging since they affect the entire market. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a portfolio with respect to the whole market. Beta gives the true picture of how a stock market risk compares to the larger market. Moreover, beta establishes the similarities and differences between a strategic risk/market risk stock and other stocks in the market. Beta is usually calculated using the regression analysis and has found great use in the capital asset pricing model. A beta of 1 shows that the security/stock price will be in line with the market. A negative beta portrays that the price of the security will be less volatile compared to the market. A positive beta shows that the price of the security will be more volatile if compared with the market. it is necessary to note that a beta of more than one indicates a higher return on investment, but exposes the investment to more risks. Risk management process. According to Damodaran (2008), risk management is a process that involves five steps. The steps include risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, treatment of risk and finally monitoring. Many studies reveal that adoption of the five steps ensures that all considerations are weighed appropriately before designing the risk management approach to employ. Risk identification This step allows individuals to recognize the risks that face the firm. For risk management process to commence, the management and staff members must be aware of the potential problem that faces the firm.  Risk identification should be conducted frequently to ensure that emerging risks are noticed before they turn to be catastrophic. Risk analysis After identifying the risk, the next step is to assess the nature and potential of the respective risks. This step is important since it gives an insight of how the identified risk might affect the goals and objectives of the organisation.  Essentially, risk analysis should be done proficiently since it provides a roadmap to the designing of the risk management policy. Risk evaluation This involves assessment of the risks and ranking them according to their magnitude, occurrence potential and anticipated loss to the organisation.   This step involves decision making on whether the analysed risk is acceptable or warrants treatment. In essence, ranking risks is an important approach to risk management since it shows whether the available resources can be sufficient to cover uncertainties in case they happen. Treatment of risk Once the risks have been evaluated and ranked, risk response planning is done. The process involves assessing the highest ranked risks and establishing the best approach to address them. The main objective of this step is to ensure that the probability of negative risks is maintained at the lowest level possible. In this regard, risk mitigation strategies, contingency management plans, and preventive mechanisms are employed to ensure that the organisation does not suffer adverse financial consequences. Reviewing and monitoring risk The final step is to monitor the risk management process. In this cases, the organisation assesses whether the approaches to risk management are effective. Risk management approaches Risk management can be done in different approaches. The approaches include risk avoidance, acceptance, transfer, and reduction. Risk avoidance is appropriate when the anticipated loss is too huge to bear. Risk avoidance is the best strategy for risk management since the activity that is projected to cause potential uncertainties is abandoned.  However, the approaches have some disadvantages as far as investment is concerned. For instance, risky activities can be very profitable to an organisation. Therefore, avoiding such activities denies the organisation the opportunity to exploit profitable investment opportunities. Risk reduction Risk deduction is another appropriate strategy for risk management. The approach ensures that the impact of loss is minimised in case it occurs. In essence, the approach appreciates that risky activities can be very profitable to an organisation, and therefore it is not necessary to abandon them. Risk reduction is the commonest approach adopted in the modern business world since investors are attracted to risky business opportunities. Risk transfer Risk transfer involves entering into an insurance contract to cover against losses that might be suffered in case the risk insured against occurs. The insured is expected to remit periodic payments referred to as premiums. On the other hand, the insurer is expected to compensate the insured in case the risk insured against occurs. Risk transfer is important since it ensures that an organisation returns to the financial position it was before the risk insured against occurred. Risk acceptance The approach recognizes that other risk management methods involve some costs. In this regard, the approach provides that accepting risks is a non-cost strategy and can be very effective for managing minor cost. Performance evaluation of the existing portfolio The current risk portfolio does not warrant financial solution for the next twenty years. For instance, the projected returns from   2016 to 2036 reveals that much has to be done to reduce the annual shortfalls in pension payment. The first group of retirees is anticipated to start receiving the pension benefits from 2018. The annual payout on pensions for 2018 is estimated to be £45,000, which shows that there will be an annual shortfall of £24,765 since the existing portfolio has the potential to generate only £ 6,879 during that year. This shows that the cooperative is set to experience huge financial problems in the near future. A further analysis of the existing portfolio shows that the cooperative will not manage to fund the pension scheme with the proceeds from its investments. In essence, the cooperative is likely to face annual shortfall throughout its life if a new portfolio is not developed soon. The members should recognize that the economic world has become quite competitive in present days. Moreover, the modern technology has brought massive change and influence on investment decision made by individuals and institutional investors. In this case, the members should embrace change and seek the service of investment experts to ensure that the cooperative’s portfolio can meet all the financial obligation in the present and future situations (Greenstreet, 2002). Recommendations and justifications on the appropriate asset valuation approaches. Asset valuation is a mechanism adopted to determine the worth of an organisation based on real property, security or any other valuable items (Damodaran, 2012). Essentially, asset valuation is necessary since it provides the necessary information required when selling an asset or buying an insurance policy. Asset valuation is done on both subjective and objective measurement basis to ensure that both the qualitative and quantitative features of a firm or corporation are featured. For instance, it is difficult to determine the value of a company’s brand name and, therefore, qualitative techniques have to be used.    There are different methods for asset valuation, which include cost method, market value method, base stock method and many others. Fortunes Inc should employ valuation methods such as the cost method, market value method and average cost method.  Stowe (2007) state that the cost method is based on the purchase price of the asset being valued. Fortunes Inc has been in existence for the last ten years and therefore it has accumulated a number of assets. In this regard, valuing the cooperative’s assets in accordance with the present prices can aid in determining how much it is worth. However, this method is complex to use since the costs of some assets are interdependent. The market value method provides a platform to determine the net worth of the enterprise on the basis of the current market prices. This provides an effective means of identifying whether the available assets of the enterprise are sufficient to meet the current needs of the market (Vallejo, Rodríguez, & Arregui-Ayastuy, 2011). Lastly, the average cost method facilitates effective valuation of assets that are difficult to differencing. In essence, use of the three methods can be very effective in revealing the true worth of the cooperative. The members of fortune Inc should establish a comprehensive asset valuation plan that ensures all aspects of the cooperative are covered. Such a plan would ensure that the decisions made are based on the production capacity of the cooperative. In addition, it would ensure that investments done are with the company’s capacity. Assessment and recommendations for suitable performance Gap Analysis The present performance of Fortunes Inc does not match with the expected financial requirement in future. The cooperative has not exhausted all the productive investment opportunities, and this can be one of the causes for its poor performance. For instance, the cooperative has majored its investment priorities on ordinary shares and the stock market. The investment approach for the cooperative is inappropriate for an organisation whose financial obligations are expected to rise for over two decades. The cooperative has forgone profitable investment opportunities in areas such technology and the capital market. In addition, the ignorant of members about the emerging investment opportunities has resulted in underutilization of the cooperative’s potential. The members should explore new investment opportunities, conduct extensive research and seek expatriate services to bridge the investment gap that the cooperative is experiencing (Franklin, 2006). Suitability of procedures and methods employed Fortunes Inc is quite rigid in its policies and approaches to the changes in the business world. The cooperative has not invested in areas that promote creativity and innovation. In addition, the members hold different views concerning how the pension scheme should be managed. The procedure to problem-solving for the cooperative is a bit complex since all members must be present. In this regard, there is need separate the management of the cooperative from that of the pension scheme. Apparently, expatriate services and professional proficiency are required to ensure that the pension funds are sourced sufficiently and managed appropriately. Benchmark A benchmark can be described as the practice of testing a set of operations or performance plans to evaluate and identify the best (Platen & Heath, 2006). A benchmark is a crucial aspect of portfolio management as it shows the best performing projects and the investment opportunities that promise reputable plans. The members of Fortunes Inc should conduct a benchmark to evaluate the various available investment opportunities and implement the necessary policies to improve the performance of the poor projects in the existing portfolio. Risk adjustments Operating a portfolio of investment is a risky undertaking that requires a high level of competency in decision making. Fortunes Inc should consider working with other institutions such as the investment banks to minimise the probability of risk and diversify the revenue base. In addition, the cooperative should seek insurance services from renowned insurance companies to minimise the probability of suffering huge losses.', 'The CDC, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety And Inspection Services, has announced the Salmonella Dublin infection outbreak that has been linked to ground beef. The outbreak has been reported in several states, and the investigations are still ongoing to determine the extent of the epidemic. The report indicates the illness might not yet be reported because it takes two to four weeks for the symptoms to develop. However, the CDC has offered some guidelines to the citizens in order to stay on the safe side. The CDC advises people to avoid eating raw or undercooked meat. The meat should be separated from other foods to be eaten without cooking, like fruits. After touching uncooked meat, one should wash hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. It also advises that beef should be cooked to 1600F before consumption. This paper discusses the implications of this outbreak to the health sciences. The complexity of Salmonella Dublin illness makes control difficult and thus the precautions. In the past, the strain has been known to resistant to conventional treatments, and extreme measures have to be taken to keep it in control (Milanov et al., 2019). The primary aim of the health sciences is to study the causes of the infection, transmission, control, and cure in order to improve health. Salmonella is generally transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated foods. It infects and multiplies in the small intestines leading to inflammation. After the infection, the symptoms take two to four weeks to develop (CDC, 2019). The symptoms include fever and diarrhea. The aim of the health science department in the nation is to inform people on general hygiene to prevent infection, the signs to look for, and when to seek medical intervention. In conclusion, there has been a recent outbreak of Salmonella Dublin illnesses across several states in the United States. It is the responsibility of the health sciences to determine the cause of the current epidemic and develop intervention measures. The CDC advises people to observe general hygiene and avoid eating undercooked meat. They have urged people to separate raw meat from other foods eaten raw like fruits and vegetables. The symptoms to watch out for include fever and diarrhea. Those with these symptoms should seek medical interventions promptly.', 'Symbolic interactionism is a theory that focuses on how the symbols are fundamental to the societies, our self-concept and our minds. Dillon (2019), analyses the concepts of Symbolic interactionism as advanced by Blumer in the mythology three premises. One of the guiding principles of symbolic interactionism is our action towards things based on meaning. According to Blumer, we learn symbols and associate the same symbols to particular purposes. The definitions entail how a person acts towards the thing, the attitudes, and how we use the idea. (Dillon, 2019, p. 261) Secondly, the implications we give to objects originates from our social interactions. From the social interactions with the members of a given society, a person can derive the meaning of things. Blumer notes the person one hangs with has an impact on the purposes of things around such a person. A person who is so much diverse in social interactions has more diversity in the interpretation of things. Such diversity tends to affect the behavior, sense of self and relationship. Besides, the application of the meanings to the things one encounters involves an interpretive procedure where we undergo self-communication. This means we develop a self that is an object of our thoughts. Moreover, Blumer outlines that one’s-self adapts and develops through interaction with other people. \nSymbolic interactionism is a micro-sociological concept since it focuses on the relationships among individuals in society. This exchange of meanings through language and symbols regards people as active objects in shaping the social world rather than being acted upon. However, various psychologists have criticized the theory for lack of micro-level issues such as emotions and unconscious. Two problems that have affected symbolic interaction theory is lack of clarity about the concepts and failure to create a systematic set of principles that constitute a theory. G.H Mead and Herbert pinpoint that the ideas were not outlined in a particular orderly manner resulting in many interpretations (Dillon, 2019, p. 256). According to the psychologists, the ambiguity of the concepts and variables hampers the ability to assess the theory, e.g. ambiguity in what constitutes the self. \n The theory of looking glass self is a concept that states that the self grows from society’s interpersonal interactions and the perception of the people. The idea suggests that people shape themselves based on their understanding of others. He argues that self is a product of our social interactions with others that involves the following steps: the imagination of our appearances and feelings to others, imagining others are evaluating our behaviors and imaginary evaluations of ourselves as objects. George Herbert Mead used the concept to develop a theory of social behaviorism. In this theory, Herbert explains how social experiences form individuals’ personality. His central idea is the self, where he outlines that the part of the character is made of self-awareness and self-image. The author claims that self is not present at birth hence must be developed with social experiences (Dillon, 2019). He argues that social interactions give rise to self since as one puts out the personality on display; thus, one mirrors the self depending on reactions of the other. \nMead uses the term significant gestures to reflect upon the unique capacity of humans to express the ideas via gestures that arouse the same meanings to another person. As humans acquire symbols, they become empowered to interact with others. Through this language, one can obtain information and ideas, understand self, share feelings and know other people. The symbols allow people to communicate. For instance, when one writes words in a textbook, the intention is to communicate to the reader. As one reads, one gives each symbol a meaning. The theory has two essential notions: we tend to adapt to other people’s actions, and the symbolic interactions connect us to the society, join the community to us and reflect the community in which we act (Dillon, 2019). Besides, the basis for growth in the community lies on the symbols as the foundations for the emergence of our mind and sense of self. However, the mind may associate different meanings to one symbol that results in a person’s behavior developing in a way as to repay survival. \nSection B: Question 4\n\tFeminist theory is one of the major branches in the sociology that has shifted its focus from the male point of view to the women experiences. In doing so, the theory is a light on the social glitches, trends and issues that one overlooks by the historical dominant males (Dillon, 2019, p. 310). Although the majority believes that the focus has been on girls, feminist theory views the social world in a way that uncovers the injustices, inequalities, oppression in pursuit of social justice and equity among women. Over the last years, social theories and sciences have excluded women and girls. However, the approach has focused much on the interactions and experiences within the society to ensure the whole world comprehends the social forces, relations and problems related to women. Feminist sociology focuses on analyzing the grounds of the limitations that women face when they claim equal rights with men. Through this shift, feminist theories have created social methods that are creative. Besides, it considers how the power and oppression interacts; that is, it focuses on the gendered power and oppression. Also, the theory exhibits sociological thought in a way that acts as an analytic framework for understanding the social situations that women experience. \n Dorothy Smith reframes and extends feminist standpoint theory to mark out the logical space within the feminist standpoint. She states that one sees the world from a particular point of views depending on the place of a person in society. As a result, a white, middle-class male sees the world differently than the female. Dorothy focused on the marginalization of women in society. The principal claims that the socio-political positions that women occupy may become sites of epistemic privileges, thus provide the starting points for asking questions about those who are socially and politically marginalized. Through the marginalization, women are in a position to change the existing beliefs. It involves a commitment to the views that attempts to understand the social situations among women.\nFor instance, one may enter a building without any problem. As one approaches the building, a person may see something entirely familiar that may be an “entrance”. On the other hand, another person may enter the same building and see a great stack. This illustrates a person’s social location. One of the particular useful concepts that Dorothy considers from the Marxian thought is the relations of ruling. Smith elaborates on the power relations in both the social life and mainstream sociology. The existing social structures rely on the relations of ruling. Besides, women often do not have an identity in the social system built from the relations of ruling that emerge from capitalism and patriarchy. In patriarchal capitalism, women do not contribute to the language and culture of men. Women are therefore not allowed in the work sphere of men, that us administration and ideas. Smith affirms that traditional sociology strengthens the changing powers of relations. From her definition of knowing within, Smith suggests that the only way that one can see the world we live in is from within. \nSection E: Question 12\n\tGlobalization has been one of the phenomena that consist of various dimensions. A more precise meaning might be that globalization is a social process whereby the constraints on social and cultural norms recede, and people become increasingly aware. There are at least three dimensions of globalization: economic, political and cultural. An economic aspect is a supreme form of globalization that is best marked with different convergence factors namely: capital and existence of supranational bodies. Secondly, a political organization is one of the dimensions that have become a trend toward multilateralism. Various scholars and sociologists have pondered the prospects of state in a way that regionalizes the political platforms for decision-making. The third dimension is cultural globalization that involves the cultivation of the intellects, civilization and learning of a society (Dillon, 2019, p, 446). In the modern days, cultural globalization has contributed much on the cultural standards, for instance, in Coca Colonization, cultural pluralism and hybridization. The ideas have promoted contacts between different cultures. However, from the sociological perspective, globalization may at times appear a macro phenomenon rather than a micro issue that affects daily life. However, the sociologists are concerned about the culture and movement of people. The former is a sociological aspect that affects both the economic and political dimensions socially. For instance, mergers and diversification in the media industries influence our cultural experiences as consumers. The culture has shaped globalization. Nowadays, sociology has drawn on political and economic perspectives that deal with capitalism, ownership etc. Besides, some of the core themes in sociology are power, class and gender inequalities and social divisions. Sociology lacks the monopoly on understanding the issues; thus, the subject draws from economic and political perspectives. \n\tUlrich Breck is one of the sociologists who have come up with the strand paradox in the late modern society that risks might be increasing due to scientific progress, technological progress and industrialism. The central view of the Breck’s work is that nowadays, the social production and distribution of wealth tend to contribute to the social production and reproduction of risks (Dillon, 2019, p, 458).  The threats are industrially produced, economically externalized, judicially individualized. In trying to minimize the risks that result from modernization, society addresses the unexpected outcomes leading to a reflexive modernization. Risks explain the reality while modernization focuses on the dynamics that underpin the fact. According to Beck, the former risks differ not so much on the potentials but institutional aspects. When the risks are in place, social threats become institutional. Beck pinpoints that risks are not bound to space and time hence, social staging often contributes to a forced cosmopolitization of social life where the stay becomes so much Cosmo politicized.\nThis means that life is full of anticipated catastrophe found in the transnational and political integration. As a result, Beck suggests that one should redefine sociology based on a cosmopolitan intent. The notion focuses on the differentiation of the actor’s perspective and the observer’s. Also, Beck notes the first modernity is marked by nationalism that assimilates the society of the nation. However, the modernity has a consequence where it applies logical exclusion, such as in the German and Turkish culture. As society gradually develops to cosmopolitan, it is vital to have a corresponding observer perspective based on inclusive differentiation.  Lastly, the second cosmopolitan modernity is a theme that Breck analyses. According to Breck, the organization consistently struggle for human rights. However, capitalists’ modernity is advancing in advocating for equal rights for all. Breck preserves modernity trying to analyze the risks; thus, the matter under consideration is the justification of human rights while not overlooking principles of modernity. The second modernity must, therefore, be aware of its own threatened modernity to fight for human rights.', "Language is an important tool in human socialization. In everyday communication, verbal communication is used to relay messages between the messenger and the intended recipient. However, some of the verbal phrases are sometimes controversial in that the message relayed can be interpreted to have several implications, either positive or negative. Holt (1980) stated that when two or more people meet, the output of one individual becomes the input of the other person, and this output change can result in behavior or attitude change. Furthermore, he argues that no one is free of the influence of others or of the responsibility of influencing others. This further reinforces the power that language has in human interactions and influencing human behavior. Merriam-webster (n.d) defines seduction as 'the enticement of a person to sexual intercourse,' 'temptation' or 'something that attracts or charms.' This paper delves into how insinuation can be used as means to seduction through the use of sexual innuendos. This calls for a deeper understanding of what insinuation and sexual innuendos entails. 2.0 Theoretical framework The theoretical underpinnings of this study draw from the work of Austin in Speech Act Theory (1962) and Grice in the theory of Cooperative principle (1979). The two theories were chosen because they can explain the pragmatics of language. Pragmatics generally refers to the knowledge people possess that helps them derive meaning from utterances. Other authors which this study has slowly drawn from their works are Marcella Bertuccelli Papi's two journal articles, namely Insinuating: the seduction of unsaying and The pragmatics of insinuation published in 1996 and 2014 respectively and the David M. Bell Innuendo published in 1997. This study, therefore, uses the above theories to explain what happens when and how insinuation is used as a means of seduction through the use of sexual innuendos. Speech Act Theory (SAT) From the observation that utterances have a performative aspect, Austin's Speech Act Theory was borne (Austin, 1962). Austin (1962) observed that spoken words not only have sense but also have force.  He made three-tier distinctions of utterances as outlined below (Austin 1962, 169): The first distinction was locution - the actual words uttered. The second was illocution – this refers to the intention or force behind what has been said, and the third was perlocution - the effect of the illocution on the receiver of the message. Since this study looks at the intention of individuals when uttering certain words to and the impact those words have of the receiver, this theory, therefore, provides a reasonable basis for building the arguments made. Grice's Theory of Cooperative Principle In Grice's theory of Cooperative Principle, an attempt is made in explaining how a massage that a recipient gets from what the speaker said to what he meant, that is, how the message recipient gets from the message expressed to the word implied. The theory explains that the speaker's message is interpreted beyond the conventional meaning of the utterances made. Grice believes that in communication among individuals, cooperative efforts are employed by all the parties involved for proper connection to occur. He states that participants in a conversation make conversational efforts by making conversational contributions as is required, at the necessary stage and by sticking to the accepted purpose of the discussion. The general principle of Cooperative Principle operates in four conversational maxims that were developed by Grice (1975): 1. Quantity Speaker's contribution to the conversation is as informative as required by the current purpose of the conversation. The speaker should not provide more information than what is needed. 2. Quality The utterances by the speaker should be actual of there should be evidence to back them up. 3. Relation The speaker maintains relevance to the topic. 4. Manner The speaker should be clear and avoids ambiguity or obscurity. These conversational maxims enable participants to generate inferences beyond that which is visible (Grice 1989).  These inferences are divided into two categories by Grice (1989). The first category entails conclusions that are obvious or straightforward, and therefore the listener can get the speaker's intention directly. The second category involves inferences that are conveyed by a violation of maxims. The second category of conclusions is called 'implicatures' by Grice (1975). 2.1 Insinuation In the journal article Insinuating: the seduction of unsaying, Papi (1996), under the topic of 'the said and the unsaid,' explains the relationship that exists between insinuation and theory of Cooperative Principle by Grice. He argues that Grice's framework provides the most extensive theoretical account between semantics and pragmatics hence shedding light on the topic of the said and the unsaid. He states that in the Grice's framework, four-level meaning can describe the notion of 'saying that p': '1) timeless sense of an utterance type 2) applied the timeless meaning of an utterance type 3) utterance type occasion meaning 4) utterer's occasion meaning.' (Papi 1996, 192) The diagram below dissects what is entailed in a communicated sentence: Figure: What is communicated. Source: (Papi 1996, 192) Papi (1996) further argues that Grice's attention was on the relationship between what is said and what is communicated hence coming up with the entire apparatus of implicatures that explained this relationship. He did so while maintaining the distinct fields of logical semantics and inferential pragmatics. Logical semantics analyses what is said by using the information provided by the context of the conversation and eliminating any ambiguity that may arise in meaning. Inferential pragmatics, on the other hand, analyses the significance of utterances by defining principles and procedures for identification of what is meant by a statement other than the message that is conveyed by what has been said. Papi (1996) further argues that the theoretical work of Grice in Cooperative Principle acknowledges that there exists a contextual component in the determination of the content of an utterance hence implying that there is an unsaid part functioning as a component of the said. The insinuation is a communication strategy where a messenger makes the recipient believe p while avoiding the responsibility that will befall him for communicating p (Papi 2014). Insinuation, in its micro and macro-textual format and its different degrees of nastiness, is a complex process that calls for the mind to be capable of activation and running multiple parallel mental spaces that are associated with different intentions simultaneously (Papi 2014). Primarily, two intentions are covert:  (1) the insinuator intents to communicate p; however, (2) he does not want to be held accountable for communicating p. The above intentions must remain covert if the addressor is to stay free of the accusation of malicious intent and therefore calling for the rejection of the insinuation following its unveiling. What is instead made overt is the third intention, which is explicitly linked to what is said. This serves as an attractor that the addressee is led to follow. The process of insinuation may occur over several conversational turns until the addressee detects a contradiction in contextual meaning hence triggering suspicion that what is being said is a distractor from what the speaker implying with the made statements. The insinuator, therefore, achieves his objective through manipulation of the addressee's mental states by making him assign a different meaning to the same propositional content or set a new propositional representation altogether (Papi, 2014). Papi (2014) outlines three central properties associated with insinuation as indirectness, deception, and manipulation. The three features are discussed in detail in the ensuing paragraphs. Indirectness Insinuations involve saying things without explicitly and directly saying what is meant. For example: ⦁\t Bob went out with a woman last night. (Grice, 1975) The above sentence implies that the woman that Bob was seen with last night was not his wife or girlfriend. This is because had the speaker known that the woman was Bob's girlfriend or wife, the sentence would not have been framed like that. Therefore, 'a woman' is indirectly used to mention that Bob might be having an affair with the woman he was seen with. Another example of indirectness as used in insinuation is outlined below: ⦁\tYour wife has seen Bob quite often recently. The example above insinuates that the wife of the addressee has been seen with a particular person called Bob. Quite often in the recent past. Hence she might be having an affair with Bob in question. However, the insinuated meaning can only become apparent to the addresses if he associates the information provided with some other knowledge in his mind. The addressee will only get the literal meaning of the sentence if he associates the knowledge provided in the sentence with his knowledge that Bob is, in fact, a friend who continually suffers from a particular condition. Like depression. He hence requires the constant presence of his friends to help him overcome the situation. The literal meaning the addressee will, therefore, get is that Bob is going through depression again. This, however, works retrogressively to the speaker who was insinuating adultery, which will eventually compel him to introduce additional information if the addressee is to get his intended meaning. It can, therefore, be observed that for insinuations to be triggered, the listener's attitude of mind and the speaker's attitude of mind have to be factored in (Papi, 2014). Insinuation cannot be realized by explicit stating of 'I want to insinuate' hence it the speaker's intention has to be covert to make an insinuation. Insinuations are a form of indirect communication. Deception Insinuations can be treated as a form of deception. However, this is only to serve a superordinate goal like manipulation (Papi, 2014). Truthfulness is realized only on deeper understanding by looking at the relationship between the explicit intentions and the hidden intentions of the speaker. It is found that the speaker is not untruthful in what he utters; instead, he is untruthful t make the listener believe his intentions align with what he says. The vital characteristics of deception in insinuation are not saying soothing false or implying something incorrect (these two might be the case but are not the primary goal of the insinuation). Instead, the vital characteristic of deception is misleading the addressee to believe that what the speaker says is the most relevant part of his intentional communication. In this regard, the insinuation is intended to achieve a malicious goal. Manipulation Papi (2014) states that just like manipulation, insinuation must remain covert. He also says that different states of manipulation possess varying levels of covertness. He hypothesized that covertness pertains to the primary intention and that for insinuation to be successful, this primary intention must remain covert.  Insinuations may also share a deliberate intention with purpose, but the difference comes about in the type of deception involved. In manipulation, the kind of fraud committed is motivated by various things with various goals, while in insinuation, the kind of trick involved focuses on what p will have on the interlocutor (Ibid). Insinuation, therefore, share some properties of manipulation, use some of the instruments of manipulation and also serves some goals of manipulation despite them not being the same. Example 3 below illustrates how insinuations can be manipulative by looking at the accounts of how Iago uses poisonous insinuation to manipulate Othello in Shakespeare's Othello. He states to the public . . . while this honest fool /plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes, / And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, I'll pour this pestilence into his ear / That she re- peals him for her body’s lust; / . . . So will I turn her virtue into pitch / And out of her own goodness make the net / That shall enmesh them all.", 'Discuss standards 1 and 7 as the two NMBA Registered Nurse Standards and Practice that align with the evaluation.

Starting a firm is only one aspect of entrepreneurship; another is developing an attitude that welcomes risk-taking, ingenuity, and flexibility. To stay competitive, increase their market share, guarantee sustainability, and guarantee efficiency, entrepreneurial companies aggressively seek for chances for innovation. Four main reasons why companies look for innovation are listed here together with definitions. 1. Competitive Advantage A competitive advantage is a companys capacity to set itself apart from rivals by providing distinctive goods, services, or methods of operation. Innovative companies have an advantage in the market since they may create outstanding products that more satisfy consumer wants. Corporations that combine artificial intelligence (AI) to provide customized consumer experiences, for example, generally outperform conventional corporations (Smith, 2023). Companies that make R&D investments also keep their products constantly improving, which increases brand recognition and customer loyalty. Encouragement of creativity helps businesses to keep ahead of rivals and retain a strong industry presence. 2. Market Expansion Expanding a market means bringing fresh ideas into new geographical areas or client sectors. Entrepreneurial companies search for creativity to enter once untapped markets or generate whole new demand. This is especially typical in developing countries, where companies powered by technology greatly affect economic growth. By offering digital banking solutions to millions of people who before had limited access to traditional banking, fintech firms, for instance, have transformed financial services (Johnson & Lee, 2021). By means of innovation, a companys customer base is diversified and new markets are expanded, therefore lowering the risks connected with economic downturns. 3. Operational Efficiency Operational efficiency is the capacity of a company to maximize procedures, lower expenses, and raise general output by creative application. Modern technologies such data analytics, machine learning, and automation let companies simplify processes and improve decision-making. Adoption of smart industrial technology has accelerated manufacturing speed and reduced resource waste, therefore lowering the waste (Brown, 2022). Good operations help companies to remain nimble in a fast-paced company environment, allocate resources properly, and boost profitability. Companies that give operational efficiency a priority through innovation will be fast able to meet demands including changing customer tastes and supply chain interruptions. 4. Long-Term Sustainability Long-term sustainability is guaranteeing a companys continuous prosperity by means of regulatory compliance, consumer expectations, and market conditions adaptation. Companies who neglect innovation run the danger of becoming out of current as sectors change. Beyond product creation, sustainable innovation incorporates business social responsibility projects and ecologically responsible methods. Businesses using sustainable business approaches attract to modern consumers who give ethical and environmentally conscientious businesses first priority. Focusing on electric vehicles and renewable energy sources, Tesla, for instance, has positioned itself as a leader in the automotive sector (Miller, 2020). Businesses improve their reputation, follow rules, and attract a devoted clientele by matching their approaches with trends in sustainability. Conclusion Innovative companies seek a competitive advantage, enter new markets, increase operational efficiency, and guarantee long-term sustainability by means of creativity. These elements support the development, resilience, and capacity of an organization to flourish in a corporate environment growing more and more competitive. Companies may react to industry developments, satisfy customer expectations, and maintain their position as market leaders by encouraging an innovative culture.', 'Analogous estimating is a method that estimates a variety of project parameters such as project cost, budget, and scope, and measures of scale-like project size, scale, and complexity. It can help in determining task duration by scaling the duration up or down by the appropriate amount, or by identifying the difference in materials and establishing the hours it would take to complete the task. Parametric model estimating is a technique that involves the drilling down of the work into a unit cost. The unit cost established by the model could help in determining the duration of the tasks and the resource effort needed. The three-point estimating technique entails the determination of three numbers, optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic for the ideal estimation of a project task’s value. The method determines task duration and resource effort by calculating the average task duration when the project repeats the task. Expert judgment estimating is a method whereby the provision of assessment is by specific criteria and expertise. Employing the technique in determining task duration and resource effort is possible through an estimation provided by an expert in the field. Vendor bid analysis is a technique that is useful in determining the project cost by comparing the bids submitted by the suppliers. The method could help in determining the project’s duration and resource effort by comparing the proposals presented by the bidders for the project work. Reserve analysis is a technique that project managers often implement in determining the budget of the project. The technique could help determine task duration and resource effort through the analysis of a project from a cost overruns point of view and placing buffers at the appropriate places. The bottom-up analysis is an estimating technique that allows for the ability to get more refined estimates of a specific component of work. The method could help determine the task duration and resource effort by breaking the tasks into smaller components and developing individual estimates. Question 2 The critical path of a project in project management refers to the sequence of project network activities adding up to the longest overall duration, which leads to the determination of the shortest period possible to complete a project. Identifying the critical path involves six steps. Step 1 involves specifying each activity using a work breakdown structure whereby the individual identifies each activity involved. Step 2 is the establishment of dependencies, whereby the project manager seeks to identify activities and their precedence to help in determining the correct order for completing tasks. Step 3 entails drawing the network diagram to allow for the visual representation of the order of activities. Step 4 involves estimating the completion time of the activities, which is possible through using past experiences or a team member’s knowledge. Step 5 is the identification of the critical path, which is possible through eyeballing the network diagram developed and identifying the longest path throughout the network. Step 6 and the final step, would involve updating the critical path to show progress since the project manager learns the actual completion time of tasks as the project progresses. Question 3 Project baseline refers to where the project manager stores the scheduled values agreed upon during the planning process that further acts as a point of reference. Question 4 The procedure for establishing a project baseline involves nine essential steps. The first step is learning as much information as possible regarding the project. The second step is forming the team and understanding the stakeholders. The third step is developing a project charter to ensure that the critical components of the project are understandable. The fourth step is creating a work breakdown structure (WBS) that defines the project’s scope and allow for easy scheduling, estimation, and monitoring of the project. The fifth step is developing a project timeline to identify the activities required to create the deliverables identified in the WBS. The sixth step is to resourcing the plan by estimating the resource requirements of each event. The seventh step is finalizing the project schedule while finalizing the project budget appears as the next step. Step nine is completing the baseline plan. Question 5 Managing adjustments to a project baseline is possible through a change control process that involves identifying, evaluating, and managing changes throughout the life cycle of the project. Question 6 Project variance is most effectively managed through focusing on the variable of scope, schedule, and cost in the analysis. Question 7 The four phases of the project life cycle include the initiation, planning, execution, and closure phases. The initiation phase is where the project management team identifies the need, problems, or opportunities, and assessing the team’s ability to meet those needs. The planning phase involves creating a project plan, a workflow document, estimating the budget, and gathering the necessary resources as well as anticipating risks. The execution stage is where the project management team creates tasks and organize workflows, brief team members on the tasks, enhance communication within the team, monitor work quality, and manage the budget. Finally, the closure phase involves analyzing the performance of the project and the team, documenting the closure of the project, conducting post-implementation reviews, accounting for the budget portion used and unused, and remaining on the task even after the completion of the project’s work. Question 8 Schedule Network Analysis is a tool used for graphical representation of schedules showing the sequenced activities and time taken to complete each task. Critical Path Analysis is an algorithm that is useful in scheduling several project activities. Schedule Compression is a project management tool employed in shortening a schedule already developed. Question 9 The three best-practice time management methodologies include Schedule Network Analysis, Schedule Compression, and Schedule Control. Schedule Network Analysis is capable of depicting each sequenced activity and the time each takes to finish. However, the limitation lies in complex projects since employing the method in such scenarios might be challenging. Applications include in analyzing possible events, shortening the schedule, and defining critical tasks with the outcome being a better understanding of the project scenario. The capability of Schedule Compression is that it shortens the schedule of the project without affecting its scope. Its limitation is that it may lead to increased cost and risk to the project. Its application can be in meeting an updated delivery date for the project while its outcome is the provision of a new opportunity. The capability of Schedule Control is that it helps in understanding the cost and plan ahead for the project. ITs limitation, on the other hand, is that the tool has no control over the external environment. Its application can be in managing the project’s efficiency while its outcome is an increased understanding of the project’s deliverables. Question 10 Building project schedules begin with a WBS. A WBS provides a hierarchical reflection of the project’s work in regards to its deliverables. A WBS breaks down the work into smaller manageable components, with each having its time for completion. Thus, leading to the creation of project schedules.', 'Analyze the problem Containing respiratory infections at the source by using a face mask is an appropriate approach. With the huge number of asymptomatic individuals, the universal use of face masks is strongly advocated to control the infection (Esposito et al., 2020). However, there is a huge concern for the shortage of masks in communities. As such, medical face masks need to be reserved for healthcare personnel. It is believed that cloth masks recommended by CDC are likely to help protect the population from contracting the infection (Esposito et al., 2020). The manufacturing of cloth masks is easy and is reusable. Authorities worry about how people should wear and dispose of masks, but it can be attained through public education. On the other hand, some individuals claim that wearing face masks can engender a false sense of security compared to other prevention measures of COVID-19 (Cheng, Lam & Leung, 2020). We are aware of the implications the general population might get into if they do not wear face masks. The empirical evidence on wearing face masks might be overlooked, but it is important to do mass masking. Since there are workers who cannot work at home, masking is important to contain the fast spread of the disease. However, basic public health principles underpin mass masking, which might not be appreciated sufficiently by the public or authorities (Cheng, Lam & Leung, 2020). The utilization of masks in society brings a meaningful reduction in the spread of COVID-19. Face masks can be compared to driving safely; pedestrians and other road users benefit from safe driving, and if everyone practices safe driving, the risks of road accidents are minimized (Cheng, Lam & Leung, 2020). Meaning and Findings of the Data A report published by the World Health Organization in April 2020 indicates that many individuals are asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 (Esposito, 2020). Since one of the transmission processes is the inhalation of large droplets, wearing masks can help minimize its spread. COVID-19, not the only respiratory infection that can be prevented by the use of face masks, also infections such as pulmonary tuberculosis. According to Lau et al. (2020), surgical face masks have shown to intercept other Coronaviruses when an infected individual cough. Masks are made of various designs and materials influencing its filtering capacity. Depending on the standards of evaluating mask, the most important aspect is its capability to protect an individual wearing it from infectious particles. It is important to note that the N95 and surgical masks both play a huge role in the interception of the particles in the air because it cuts down 95% of the breathing, sending the virus up to six feet away in a room. The particle size for speech ranges from 5 µm-10 µm. The typical filtration capacity of the household material is between 49% and 86% for particles sized 0.02 µm. In comparison, the filtration capacity of the surgical mask was 89%. On the other hand, cloth face masks had a filtration rate of 3% compared to surgical masks, with a 60% filtration rate in a laboratory setup (Howard et al., 2020). Cloth masks that people use are not respirators as compared to N95 worn by healthcare workers. N95 form a tight seal over the mouth and nose and filters all the air going out and coming in. People have opted to use cloth face masks because of the insufficient supply of surgical face masks (Cheng, Lam & Leung, 2020). Mass masking will help to minimize the number of infections from respiratory diseases. Recommendations and Help Wearing face masks in public will guarantee the health and safety of the general population, and this executive order will be achieved with the help of congress members. The number of new infections and deaths amid the COVID-19 pandemic reported daily is rising, which is why the public should wear masks. It is difficult to know who is infected or not infected with the fast-spreading COVID-19 because asymptomatic individuals do not show any signs and symptoms. Through this move, everyone will see the benefits accrued from the prevention of Coronavirus by wearing masks. The pandemic has opened everyone’s eyes as it has brought the world to a standstill. No one ever imagined that they would wear masks in public. Mass masking is not enough without educating the public. Thus, I recommend the public health officials to create awareness and educate the public on how to wear the mask because it will be meaningless if the masks are worn wrongly. As such, the chosen congress members will propose the house regarding mass masking. They will influence other members to back up the motion to aid the negative impacts of not wearing a mask amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Let’s wear face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.']
