human_texts = ['The modern American police force has borrowed some of its means to serve people from the England police service units. American law enforcement agencies have adopted; the strategy of a patrol that is preventive, the quasi-military design of organization, and the mission of control and crime prevention from the London police department. In addition to the three elements, the Americans have borrowed other British systems of policing thus the two systems exhibiting a lot of resemblances. In both America and Britain the police have limitations on their authority. This has led to the protection of individual liberty, which has brought in limits on both police authority and the government. Americans have also borrowed the local control of police agencies from the English (Champion, 2003). Many countries have central and national law agencies of enforcement, but this is contrary to both the Americans and the English. In America, the systems of law enforcement such as the police are controlled by the state, local and federal government. However, most American departments are local municipalities. A defining feature that has shown how heavily the American policing has borrowed from the English is the fragmented and highly decentralized systems of law enforcement (Champion, 2003). Lack of co-operation and co-ordination among the law enforcement agencies in America has served as a characteristic of the America law enforcement systems. The quasi-military organization structure in the modern England can describe the Anglo-Saxon policing witnessed in America. Despite all the similarities the American policies have with that of the English, there are also differences. The most significant difference is that there is no political influence of the policing institutions in Britain as compared to the robust political relationship seen with the American policing units (Champion, 2003). This political influence has led to lots of ridicule of the American policy which has led them to be termed as corrupt and a unit that lacks professionalism. Part 2 Modern fire safety standards and codes trace their origins from the 19th- century. In the 19th- century fire extinguishing was characterized by automatic sprinklers (NFPA 5000, 2006). Since the beginning sprinklers have performed as fire extinguishers but they were originally installed in different methods which led to their reliability is uncertain. The fire code was originally known as” Building Exits Code”. The name exists due to the efforts of making factories safe in the 19th century. The code mainly focuses on fire escapes and fire drills in the bid of reducing increased fire deaths in factories. Some of the original fire codes include •    Building owners must ensure that their fire exists point have no obstacles and obstructions. They were also required to keep their records of each inspection •    Fire sprinklers should be installed in all buildings that hold a capacity of more than a hundred people. •     In any meeting that involves more than fifty people, there should be a fire expert present. However, this code excluded religious meetings and gatherings. America has experienced numerous changes in the 21st century. Growing technology characterizes the change. This has led to the fire code growing regarding scope. The fire extinguishers units have incorporated protection of interior finish, detection systems, and alarms as a way to reduce the effect of fire calamities. The original codes have been reviewed and updated to suit the changing fire scenarios. The codes have been used to influence and ensure that the fire safety requirements are met and enforced.', '\n\n\n\n\nAction Against Obesity in Children Aged 11-15 years\nName\nCourse\nTutor\nDate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nObesity is an increasing issue with throughout the United States that affects many individuals.  Obesity is defined when a person has an excessive amount of body fat.  An individual will be considered obese when they exceed what is considered their “normal weight” by at least 20 %.  It is true that there are many overweight and obese children aged 11-15, recent studies have shown that there has been an increase in the amount of children that are diagnosed as being obese or who could become obese in the future. \nDue to the conveniences of fast food restaurants, more and more families are eating these types of foods and do not realize the affects these foods have on the body and how these restaurants are one of the leading causes of obesity (Ewles and Simnett, 2005).  Another factor that has been a large contributor to the increase in obese children is the lack of physical activity.  With the popularity rise of video gaming system, television and computers children are not going outdoors to play sports and get daily exercise.  Though these are two of the leading causes of obesity in children, there are other things that contribute to this fast growing problem. Other habits that could lead to children aged 11-15 years being obese are eating more than the recommended portions or binge eating to relive stress. Besides the lack of proper eating, obesity is also a genetic trait.  If within a child’s family history there is are diagnosed cases of obesity, they have a greater chance of being genetically following in the histories footsteps of becoming obese.  Mostly, if a child’s biological mother is obese as an adult there is about an 80 % chance through genetics that they too will be overweight or obese (Werner, Andrew and Hardigree, 2007). The same also goes if the biological mother is thin; the children in turn have the same percentage to be thin as an adult. Through research, it also shows that as a person ages their metabolism rate decreases. This decrease in metabolism makes burning fat harder, in turn making it easier to become obese later in life.  Another factor that will play a large role in the development of obesity is the absence of daily physical activity.  Physical activity throughout the day can cause a decrease in one’s appetite and also maintain the metabolism to properly burn fat as an energy source.\nFigure 1: Factors that Impact on Health. Source: (Fertman and Allensworth, 2010)  \n\nEvaluation\nAccording to Hawe, (1994), evaluation is the process that is used to make sure that the effectiveness of a project is achieved as earlier planned. In the health promotion sector, evaluation is the process of assessing then extent to which an action achieves a valued outcome. Through evaluation of the action against obesity in children aged 11-15 years helps in making sure that the results that were intended have been achieved accordingly. Again, it is through evaluation that one can know if the methods that were used are effective or not and how the health practice ought to be improved for the sake of justifying the use of resources (Green and Tonse, 2010). Evaluation of health interventions can be carried under focus groups, appreciative inquiry, participatory appraisal, questionnaire, personal interviews and all participants and non-participant’s observation. When doing evaluation, it is important for one to consider both short term indicators linked with change and long term indicators. \nThe reason as to why the action against obesity in children was the health issue chosen was for the sake of comparing changes in health status and all the standards of acceptability. Choosing to study obesity among children 11-15 years was due to the fact that many children at this age have gained a lot of weight from their different lifestyles. Such actions employed for use in controlling obesity were successful as through obesity case studies and research, it has been confirmed that an individual that has been diagnosed as being obese has a lower quality of life than those who maintain a healthy diet and weight.  Enjoying time and doing activities with friends and family can be more difficult for a person who is obese. Also, damaging effects on the body and organs are thought to be caused by obesity as well as being a cause of premature death. There are also many complications with health with obese children which are prevented through education and awareness program (Green and Kreuter, 1999). These complications and conditions include: strokes, heart disease and diabetes.  Though these are all life threatening conditions, with damaging affects one condition that could hurt more is the toll and scars that is placed on the emotions of an obese individual.  Those who suffer from obesity become emotional torn down and will isolate themselves and avoid going out into public places because from discrimination and prejudice actions that they have experienced at social functions, school and in the work place that they have become ashamed and embarrassed about their weight and appearance.  Through actions of some in society, obese children will experience and develop increased levels of depression and shame, thus have a fear of rejection.  However, it is through education and intervention that all these obese issues can easily be handled. \nCritical Discussion of Social Media Approaches to Health Promotion\n\t Basically, evidence based health promotion refers to implementation, development and evaluation of effective programs and other type of policies that will be used in the health. Such application entails the application of evidence that will be used and all the systemic appraisal of research under a better use of planning methods. \nMoreover, to ensure that evidence based health promotion appeals to the target group, it has to depend on factors like; availability of information, whether the evidence provided can be trusted and is of a higher standard and the expert knowledge provided that can be used to interpret and understand the evidence provided. \nExposure \nThrough getting access to the right exposure, some of the strategies that can be used to educate the population on matters linked with evidence based health promotion is through interpreting and provision of evidence where necessary. In the past, there has not been a sure way in the treatment process of obesity and being overweight besides getting exposure to a healthy eating and exercise routine (Israel, Chechoway, Schulz and Zimmerman, 1994).  With advancements in technology and medical interventions, obese individuals are turning to surgery to rid themselves of fat.  Among the surgical treatments available liposuction has proven to be the most popular.  With this procedure fat is sucked directly from a person’s body.  This is a popular procedure because the recovery time and time it takes to perform liposuction is a relatively short process. \nEngagement  \nAnother surgical procedure that has become quite popular is gastric bypass surgery that entails one’s engagement.  This procedure has been a lifesaving procedure for many overweight and obese individuals.  There are several ways this type of procedure can be performed and slight variations on what is actually done, but the concepts are the same.  In this procedure staples or a band is placed around a small portion of the stomach decreasing its size so the individual will become full sooner and not eat as much (Katz, peberdy, Douglas, 2000). This will produce a decrease in the portions sizes that can be eaten as well as reducing the calorie intake. This is usually a procedure that can be done laparoscopically through small incisions in the abdomen with a guided lighted tube with a camera attached to it.  Performing the procedure in this way helps reduce the recovery period which in turn lowers the hospitalization cost.  Also, not having an open surgery will reduce the risk factors for developing surgery related complications such as infections.  \nFigure 3: Evaluation; Pre and Post intervention: Source: (Katz, peberdy, Douglas, 2000). \n\nInfluence\nAs with any treatment plan for obesity, these are not failsafe procedures thus influence on medication is highly advocated for use.  Through the use of social media like Facebook pages, persons are made aware negative effects of obesity ad why actions ought to be taken to stop obesity. Even with these surgical procedures, the person that undergoes a procedure like these must put a maintained plan into action (Frieden, Dietz, and Collins, 2010).  This will require lifestyle changes different than those they had been doing throughout life to ensure they do not revert back to being obese.  Along with the physical changes an individual will go through in regards to their appearance, it is also recommended by healthcare professionals that they go through some type of physiological counseling to mend any mental difficulties that have developed from going through life to that point as an obese individual (Naidoo and Wills 2005). Due to the dramatic rise in childhood obesity within the past couple years, there have been school programs developed to educate children and their parents how to eat properly and what physical activities will promote healthy weight maintenance.  Within these programs, newsletters are sent home with the children to help parents and guardians provide and support what has been taught in the school program.  Though information is given to the students in school programs, this is not a guarantee that the information and tools will be used in that child’s home. \nFigure 4; Facebook Users Across the World. Source; (Rychetnik, Frommer, Harwe and Shiell, 2002)  \n\nFigure 5: Facebook Activity Based on the Type of Post and How Many Engagements. Source; (Rychetnik, Frommer, Harwe and Shiell, 2002).\n\nResults\nThe results evidence that there is a greater hope with these programs is when children are given the information and tools, which they will go home and share the information they have received and will push for the family to implement what they have learned. This is not only beneficial to children but can also help parents that may be suffering from obesity and do not have the proper knowledge of what they can do to help themselves.  There are also free lunch programs in the schools for needy families that are put into place to ensure that all children can receive a balanced and nutritional meal at school.  But for these school programs to be effective they must be implemented effectively and with the budget cutbacks and lack of proper training, in most cases they are not.\nConclusion\nIt is clear that all the interventions for use in the study have to be carefully researched, planned, delivered and well designed to suit the health issue. As seen throughout this Action against obesity paper, obesity is an increasing problem for children as well as adults.  It is estimated that one in every three adults in America, have been diagnosed as being obese and the rate is on a steady incline across the globe.  This is an issue that needs much attention to prevent the statics from increasing.  A decrease in the amount of “fast foods” consumed needs to be addressed.  Parents need to take a more aggressive role in the education and support of healthy eating plans. Also, parents need to be more proactive and not allow children to spend numerus hours indoors being occupied by video games, computers and television and spend more quality family time doing various physical activities.  Something as simple as daily evening walks, bike riding or playing ball could contribute to healthier living and weight management.  If 10 percent of Americans would take a more active role in the battle against obesity, the nation could save an estimated $ 6 billion in healthcare cost for heart disease each year.', 'There are various strategies that parents and teachers might use to help their kids develop English and promote structured oral interaction. First, teachers and parents may employ explicit instruction to establish English language use. Detailed instruction provides an ideal way for the teachers and parents to teach the English language in a structured and direct manner (Lehigh University, 2012). When teachers use explicit instruction, the lessons become more apparent and easy to understand. Secondly, precise instructions provide children with an opportunity to listen, comprehend, practice and give feedback (McKibbin & Brice, 2007). Still, explicit instructions aid learners who require serious intervention, including kids with learning incapacities. \nIn addition, teachers may boost a student’s understanding of the English language by providing concrete objects and visuals to facilitate comprehension of concepts. Teachers use images by connecting new words to the ideas that learners already understand (Lehigh University, 2012). As a result, the visuals and concepts help learners remember the concepts by providing tangible illustrations of abstract concepts exemplified in words. Still, the visuals and objects become helpful for learners whose language and symbols are structured differently than in their native language. For example, a teacher may use a picture-word wall with a picture, word and definition instead of just a word wall to enhance a learners understanding of the language.\nFurther, teachers can use facial expressions and gestures to offer additional signals when presenting vocabulary to boost development and knowledge of the English language. Facial expressions and gestures help learners and teachers communicate effectively. As a result, the coaching effectiveness is improved (Lehigh University, 2012).  \n\nPrompt 2\nBesides unfamiliar vocabulary, learners encounter specific difficulties when working with an academic text. First, most learners lack the necessary skills to unpack condensed information. The students cannot understand complex sentences and words that promote clear communication, such as embedded clauses and nominalizations (Uccelli & Phillips Galloway, 2016). Second, a significant number of learners are not able to connect ideas plausibly. The learners find it challenging to understand connectives predominant in academic texts to indicate relations between concepts. For example, most students cannot understand the use of connectors such as consequently and as a result which explain a relationship between specific ideas in academic texts.\nFurther, when working with academic texts, many students cannot track themes and participants in the text. The learners do not comprehend how to identify certain expressions used to talk about themes or former participants in an academic text. Notably, students lack the requisite skill to organize analytic skills according to conventional educational structures, especially argumentative texts such as rebuttal, thesis, argument, conclusion and counter-argument (Uccelli et al., 2016). Also, the students find it challenging to understand a writer’s viewpoint by failing to comprehend the markers that point to a writer’s perspective, particularly epistemic stance signs. The epistemic stance symbols signal a writer’s level of confidence concerning an assertion.\nConsequently, students, when working with academic text, face difficulties in comprehending metalinguistic vocabulary. The learners find it challenging to understand terminologies related to discussion and reasoning processes such as argument, generalization, and hypothesis (Uccelli et al., 2016). Conclusively, when working with an academic text, students find it challenging to recognize the academic register. As such, the learners cannot understand the additional academic language compared to more conversational language.', 'Collective bargaining is a process that involves negotiations of terms of employment between the employer and group of workers. In most instances, collective bargaining takes place between leaders of labor unions and the company management. A collective bargaining agreement must occur if the negotiations are termed successful (Kiely, 2007). The collective bargaining agreement contains rules of employment for a certain number of years. The collective bargaining process often involves labor strikes or employee lockout. This occurs when employers and employees fail to reach an agreement. However, throughout the 21st-century, collective bargaining has faced a lot of controversies particularly the workers of the public sector.  The public sector has been an area of controversy because tax revenues are responsible for the funding of the employees of public sector wages (Ernst Benjamin, 2006). Opponents of collective bargaining argue that the practice of raising the pay of public workers contributes to excessive payment, which places an undue burden on the taxpayers. Crime does not pay a debatable axiom. However, new evidence strongly suggests that the more the crime fighters are paid, the better they will combat with a crime. When police officers are given salaries that are below their expectations, then their desire to offer hundred percent protection to citizens will be compromised. On the other hand, if police officers receive better salaries then they will put hundred percent efforts to provide help and protection. The main measure of police performance is the number of crimes that they have cleared (Kiely, 2007). The number of arrests made may be affected by; police absenteeism and amounts of overtime put by police. Arrests often show costly efforts in solving the crime, in subsequent paperwork and arrest procedure. Performances by the police have collapsed when the police officers lose arbitration cases. Statistics have shown time overtimes that the per capita of the crimes cleared has risen by more than 15% following arbitration rulings that favor them. When the police lose their collective bargaining, there is an increase in crime rates by approximately 5%. This is because the police expend less energy in gathering and expanding evidence to the prosecutors. Police unions have advocated for pay raise of the police officers for them to have better living conditions. History has recurrently shown that police officers who have poor living conditions can be tempted to boost their incomes by competing with criminals for the dirty money or even taking in bribes (Ernst Benjamin, 2006). When the police officers are properly paid, they can improve relations between politicians, law enforcement, and the community. There have been instances where the police have ordered hits on criminals and even robbed drug dealers. This abuse of power by the police erodes the trust established by the citizens to the officers. This is because the citizens do not expect by the police to be fair since they are scrambling with gangs for similar gains such as dirty money. There are many temptations that the police face and therefore a police officer may be tempted to take in a bribe instead of making an arrest. When police get low wages, they are exposed to the vulnerability of getting morally and ethically seduced (Kiely, 2007). Due to low pay incidences, some members of the police union have gone on a work slowdown. The government should, therefore, ensure that the overall package of public sector workers especially the police officers and firefighters are recognized. This is because they offer key contributions in making the country a haven. The government can do this by increasing their salaries because it will boost their morale and ensure that they deliver services that are world class.', 'The case study is about a non-profit organization known as Walton Art Center, which was established to promote art in the society. Anita Scism was appointed to be the organization’s president in 1998 to succeed Mitchell. After assuming the position, Anita formed a new board to oversee the operations of the organization. The organization is facing some financial challenges that are have delayed some of its operation. The president and the board of directors are working on the strategies that can be adopted to solve the issue of financial shortages and enhance the success of the organization in all of its projects. The Walton Art Center has shown reputable progress of the past few years. However, the center has some challenges that need to be addressed before things get out of hand.  As the president, Anita Scism should come up with policies and strategies that boost positive growth of the center. Anita should use the strategic planning retreat as an avenue for developing mechanisms that can aid in boosting revenue generation for the center.   In essence, the retreat would serve as a level ground for the board of directors to share their ideas with the president and ensure that the long a long lasting solution on matters related to finance is found. To enhance inclusivity and accommodation of all Walton Arts Center stakeholders, I would reformulate the mission to read, “the home for nurturing talent, creativity and enhancing financial prosperity to artist.’ Such a mission is inspiring and attractive to corporate institutions that might be willing to partner with the center to improve the standards of living for people in the society. On top of reformulation of the mission, the center should employ a new strategy. This is because the societal needs keep changing thereby rendering some services offered by the center obsolete. In addition, the modern technology has revolutionized the arts industry and therefore a new strategy is necessary to ensure that the operations of the center match the technological and industrial needs. Organizations use different approaches to forecast the short and long term future. Some of the mechanisms used to predict the short-term and long-term future include investment policies, financial statements, economic policies, competition levels and many others. Investment policies aid in forecasting the position that an organization will occupy after a certain period of time. In essence, the investment policies of an organization determine its growth potential and its value in the market. Economic policies show how the economy is expected to behave in a given period and the corresponding consequences that arise due to manipulation of economic activities in a given industry. The financial statements portray the financial performance of an organization over a given time and aids in devising the means for expanding the business.  Lastly, the competition levels help in identifying whether an organization has the potential to bit other organizations that provide similar products or services in the market. A downturn in the economy has more adverse impacts on the non-profit organization compared to the profit organization. The non-profit organizations depend on donors and well-wishers for funds and other resources, unlike the profit organizations whose funds come from profitable business activities. In this regard, a downturn in the economy   lowers the number of donors and increases the running costs for non-profit organizations. In the case of profit organization, a downturn in the economy may present investment opportunities or avenues for developing new products lines thereby reducing financial losses. The Walton Art Center has devised a unique strategy to promote successive operation in its struggle to boost the welfare of art students. The organizations   adopt a business-level differentiation approach to conducting its business. For instance, retreats for the board of directors and rewarding artists who show proficient skills has aided in promoting a positive image of the organization. However, the organization need to eliminate activities that do not contribute direct to the development of arts. This would ensure that the available funds are used effectively and to the benefit of the appropriate persons. In addition, cutting down on expenses would increase the amount of funds available for the development of the organization. In essence, effective use of funds and other resources can aid in winning more donors and their solving the financial problems facing the organization. In summary, it is necessary for the organization to adopt effective strategies for sourcing funds to promote smooth running of activities.', 'Dear Mr. Hawkins, I want to thank you for hiring us for the consultation on the most popular apps for iPhone and other mobile devices. You asked us to research the apps that are most popular in iPhone and other mobile devices. After in-depth research on the matter and based on my professional expertise, we recommend that your company should consider venturing into building an app that provides a social-networking platform to the consumers, particularly one that allows for the sharing of images and videos as well as editing them. The remainder of this report provides a detailed account of the results of the research, including the most popular apps of iPhone and other mobile devices as discovered by the study, why we believe those apps are successful, the individuals buying those apps and the reasons behind their purchasing decision, and the features with positive comments. The Most Popular Apps of iPhone And Other Mobile Devices The article by Bell (2018) highlights that the most popular apps for iPhone are those related to social networking, with those that allow for either video or image sharing, or both, like YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat, occupying the top positions. Similarly, the most popular apps for other mobile devices are also those related to social networking, with the data on apps downloaded from Google Play Services indicating that Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Twitter are all among the top 20 apps in terms of the number of downloads (Price, 2018). Unfortunately, YouTube is not as popular for other mobile devices when compared to its popularity among iPhone users. Therefore, from the data collected, it is safe to conclude that Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat are the three most popular apps across all smartphone users. Reasons for the Popularity of Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat The three identified apps, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, are all social networking mobile applications, with the interaction they have with their users being the typical reason behind their success. We believe that the success of the three social networking apps lies in the fact that they allow the users to share both photos and videos with their friends and families, including live occurrences. Besides, the editing features provided by those apps, especially Instagram and Snapchat, makes photo sharing and video recording quite captivating and interactive. The instant messaging options offered by Facebook and Instagram are also contributing factors to the popularity of those applications. Other features like ‘stories’ that allows the users to share their photos and videos for 24 hours also makes the three apps quite popular, as they provide the users with new options. Target Populations These apps are usually available for free in the respective app stores depending on the type of mobile device an individual uses. Teenagers and young adults represent the highest percentage of individuals downloading and using those apps. The main reason behind the high number of teens and young adults associated with the three popular apps highlighted is that those applications allow them to interact with friends and keep up with the latest trends by following their idols. Companies and organizations are also finding the highlighted apps to be useful for their operations. Many companies, organizations, and other businesses across the globe are finding Instagram and Facebook to be valuable marketing tools, especially since they allow them to connect easily with their consumers as well as quickly identify their target market. Features with Positive Comments and their Importance The interaction between the popular apps highlighted and their users are the main reason behind their success, with some unique features incorporated by the developers of those apps ensuring that they maintain their position as the most popular mobile applications among smartphone users. The ‘stories’ feature is one of the elements with positive comments for the three most popular apps identified. The importance of the ‘stories’ feature is that it allows the users to share things that they consider to be fun for the moment without necessarily crowding their timeline. Other features with positive comments are emoji and editing elements. Emoji and editing features are vital since they make the shared photos and videos lively, increasing the interaction between the persons sharing and those viewing, as well as increase the user’s confidence. Another feature with positive comments is the live chat feature that allows the users to share live recordings. The element is crucial since it increases the interaction between the users while ensuring that the users do not miss incredible moments in their lives. Conclusion and Recommendation From the information presented, it is essential to note that social networking apps are the most popular mobile applications among smartphone users, with those that allow for video and photo sharing as well as editing occupying the top spots. Therefore, venturing in developing a social networking app that also allows for video and photo sharing can make you successful. Besides, incorporating interactive features like emoji and ‘stories’ can help improve the popularity of your social networking app. We will be glad to discuss our findings with you in person or provide additional details.', 'Performance in an organization is key, if set objectives must be achieved. There are a number of factors that measure performance: turnover rate, level of production, absenteeism rate  and how motivated employees are. For an organization to achieve set objectives and be highly productive, it should ensure that its manpower is well set and equipped. From the analysis of the Human Resource (HR) department, there has been an increased performance in general. This is because comparatively, from period 0- period 4, there has been an improvement in as far as the quality index is concerned. Additionally, absenteeism rate on average has reduced. The average absenteeism rate was high in period 0 as compared to period 4. The higher the rate of absenteeism, the lower the production capacity.  From the analysis, however, on average, the rate of employee turnover kept on increasing from period 0 all through to period 4. This could be a sign that employees are not very well motivated in the organization. Employee turnover measures the rate at which employees come and leave the organization. Productivity has been constant from period 0 all the way to period 4. Indicating that there has been nothing to motivate the employees to produce more. Production level goes hand in hand with motivation, and it is not an exemption in this case. The rate of accidents has reduced and there is a reduction in the rate of accidents in period 4 as compared to the start in period 0. This shhows that the organization has been doing its best to train employees regarding safety at the workplace. In conclusion, the performance of the HR department has improved but more needs to be done to achieve much better results', 'Recently the medical professionals have questioned the pricing of some of the cancer drugs in the market. Dana and colleagues examined the reasons that contribute to the pricing of the cancer drugs. Consequently, they looked into to the reflective value and research demonstrated by the pricing and health benefits the drugs give the patients. If the patients enjoy more life, the pricing becomes justified since they gain from the expensive. Moreover, a hidebound reimbursement system is to blame for the poor job in letting the prices adjust to new information about value as asserted by the authors of this article. As articulated in the article drug prices are expensive during launch and fall overtime but the system is still not efficient enough to allow the prices to behave, as they should. Regulators having set thresholds for the pricing system instituting the price floor and ceiling are also not competent enough. If the distortions were detached from the reimbursement system, enhancing lifesaving endeavours would become more articulated in the medical scene.\nA joint international cancer doctors came out and labelled the cancer drug prices as unsustainable. For the sake of the patients who are suffering, they appealed to the manufacturers to reduce their prices for a better cancer treatment program for all. Consequently, the complaint was phenomenon for the political debate over healthcare costs in the country. However, the question remained why the drug prices are high to start. One prominent reason was the fact that manufacturers are locked into the approval and reimbursement system, which twists the fundamental value of their merchandise hence making the initial price high as their best option for getting their return on investment. Moreover, regulators have set inceptions for cost-effective pricing. The threshold determines their price ceiling and price floor. If the systems were made price flexible, they would enable drugs prices to rise and fall appropriately owing to the new information on the drug value to the patients guaranteeing drugs will get to required users. When drugs cost $76,000 a year it is hard to see the value since the manufactures would keep gaining profits for a lifetime as long as the patient still lives. Therefore, it becomes inhumane to burden a patient financially in the pretence of assisting their condition (Hirschey, 2006).\nApparently, regulators and insurers are confined on a wrong path where no one can change the pricing. For instance, an insurer is not ready to pay more than the competitors are if a drug becomes more valuable with time so prices stabilise. As Medicare tries to stabilise the costs of this drugs, private insures might be forced to follow. Medicare is the largest payer for the cancer drugs according to the government accountability office. As presented by the Medicare Part B, cancer medications make 40% of the most expensive drugs. With utmost gratitude, war against cancer is prevailing thanks to innovation and technology that see to that fact. However, the drug pricing for cancer treatment should be made subtle, whether valuable or inadequate, would assist in ensuring success triumphs in saving lives.\n\nHarmonizing sustainability and cost control with reasonable and sensible admittance to\neffective new technologies is a task around the world. Costly medicine that hypothetically prolong life particularly the ones lucrative in oncology, display cost stresses on private, public, and private payers, plus the individual patients and their families. In order to assist on these tensions, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany have reputable programs that need comparative clinical and for the UK and Australia cost effectiveness for informing how decisions are made on allocation of the resources. The issues are compared across these countries’ policies on the coverage of the medications and predominantly those that assist in adding life to the patients who are near death. Based on investigation published policies, administration, and grey literature for all these countries and not forgetting individual case studies coverage decisions for end-of-life medicines, all the countries face the same problems. A vast research that was comprehensive on how the countries make coverage decisions and spending realised some differences in the systems but they are all tied up in the same pharmaceutical quagmires. Despite significant cultural and structural differences in these countries challenges come up with respect to pharmaceutical policies. In Australia and European countries, the main agenda is to curb the burgeoning pressures to pay for costly cancer drugs for patients with incurable maladies via resource-constrained schemes funded via taxes or social security without destabilisation of the primary principles. In comparison to the USA, the main agenda is to make sure there is fiscal sustainability of Medicare, the private insurance market and Medicaid. The affordable care act has broaden access to healthcare to more Americans restricting choice or triggering a repercussion from the ones well insured and the healthcare industry. However, with the prices escalating in the established markets and affordability a concern for the US insurers and the healthcare system managers, it is evident there is a battle to reconcile sustainability with the access, equity, and healthcare policies. As asserted by Dana et al, pricing of the drugs is a produce of hidebound reimbursement system. In the countries researched, system have kept the management at bay making it hard to make informed decisions since they have to follow several channels and appease all of them in order for a fundamental change to take place. Consequently, the market tends to fail since only the rich can afford most of the end of life drugs. For sustainability of a market, there must be a break-even point, which is hard to reach since the pricing makes many patients spend every penny in the quest to save the life of a family member. When there is no buyer, a market crumbles progressively. The reimbursement system is used by companies to make sure they gain their return on investment, but they continue to gain even after making back their investment and profits. This issue makes it hard for the market to grow. Therefore, the hidebound reimbursement system is key to the market failure. \nPricing strategies\nWhen pricing the new cancer drug several strategies should be included in order for the company to breakeven. A patented pharmaceutical medication in time losses the initial price when it comes off patent. As the CEO of a pharmaceutical company that has discovered a drug that cures all types of cancers, the best way to price the drug is to make sure the research and development costs are first met before the drug goes of patent. However, there are several issues to consider when making the pricing choices. Sharp declines in prices of patented drugs always show a balance in the pharmaceutical market although they introduce conflicting goals. The initial goal is boosting of a competitive market that includes generic competitors. A competitive market allows the drug market to have affordable medicine for all consumers. This ensures that many patients get the required treatment for their maladies. However, a problematic situation broods over the market if the patent is lifted when all regulatory bodies like the FDA and safety and efficacy standard certify the new drug. Pharmaceutical drugs take a long period to develop and this becomes a blow for the company where return on investment may take a long time. Estimates for research and development of a drug may be as high as $5.5 billion as per successful companies and fraught with failure. Contrary generic drugs cost less to manufacture since the original drug has been invented and approved. Taking into account this situations pricing of the new drug should fall under the research and development cost fraction in order for the drug to bring in any profits. As articulated above, the future of patients is determined by pharmaceutical companies making ends meet and gaining more funds to make more drugs that are lucrative. \nStrategy\n\tWhen the drug is certified as safe to use the initial consideration to make is a structure that will make it affordable for all consumers. This can only be achieved by the price forecasting a clear compensation to the investors. With respect to the innovation and development, the investor is the first individual to remember since they would have done something else with the investment money they put into the drug. Keeping this in mind the pricing should make sure the risk taken by the invested is considered. In a research done by the California Biomedical Research Association gave an estimate of five in 5000 drugs that begin pre-clinic tests ever reach human testing. Price balance for the drug will certainly have to reach the needs and desires of the consumers however; the risks taken by the producers have to bear in order to make sure there is creation of products. Precisely, the initial market price will reflect the cost of production; the next batch of the same product will reflect a marginal cost of production coupled with marginal value the users point to the drug. \n\tFor a great initial price, reflection of an efficient balance between the consumer desires and production costs will be included in order to contain every aspect that will assist in reaching the R&D costs. Despite the inadequacies in the pharmaceutical market, the price has to make sure it attracts the necessary financial resources for the investors for creation of new and better medicine for the patients. Competition based pricing will be included in case there the drug falls out of patent and the generic versions create competition. The competitive price will include consideration of expected competitors and the current in the market. The fine line between loss and profit is will be countered by the infusion of R&D cost for a period of time where the company would have made the required profit that assists in better researches. \nPharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) in Australia\n\tThe PBS system in Australia is a structure administered by the government to make sure there is a subsidised price for the medicine that is costly and is needed by many patients. Therefore, PBS is not the factor that makes the Australian drug market lucrative. Instead, it tries and regulates the prices the companies bring to the market. Actually, the PBS facilitates the people with better offers the companies are reluctant to give to the consumers in the country. Consequently, guidelines for threshold value of drugs are set by the system but the companies set their prices in the non-PBS market without regulation from the outside parties. As a regulator, it only gives the companies to join the listing in order to reduce the price. If the company does not comply with the set rules, they deny the company inclusion until the company reduces the price for the patients. This process is an encouragement to the pharmaceutical companies to adjust prices in order to get better recommendations from the PBAC. \n\tHowever, a committee that negotiates the pricing decides the final price. This implies that the market is still controlled by the companies with the PBS just reducing the prices by a very little fraction. The market is lucrative since the companies are busy making a kill from their drugs while the incompetent structure feigns reduction of prices. Moreover, the government cannot compel a manufacturer to list a product in the programme. This gives the market a monopoly over their prices. The government can set a price ceiling and floor after negotiations proving that the PBS system is not the factor that leads to the dominant market. \n\nGlobal drug market\nThe global market has its own set of opportunities and threats for the businesses in all ranges of industries. According to the IBIS world Global Pharmaceuticals & Medicine Manufacturing analysis of the industry on an international level, report a growth that will span in a consistent manner making the industry one of the world most lucrative industries. Five years before 2016 the market growth in the industry was moderate. However, underpinning this steady growth is the rising demand for healthcare standards and a greater emphasis on prevention of diseases give the consumer a higher significance among customers. Moreover, the global credit crisis and ensuing severity measures led to the cutting of funding by governments to healthcare researches. The industry is at its peak today as they adopt cost friendly developing strategies and merging with other companies to make up better knowledge base for drug production. The pharmaceutical environment for both innovative R&D corporations and the generics manufacturers has continued to increase competitiveness in the drug market. As often described as the best care for patents where it is the only industry where the products are brought to the consumers with a patent. Their fixed costs for manufacturing tend to be higher that other industries. \n\tThe industry keeps on growing with annual rates of 5-8%. This proves that the competition in the market is competitive. The industry is responsible for the development, marketing, and production of medication hence the enormous importance in the global sector is noticed. The level of market is estimated as one trillion U.S dollars. Consequently, North America has the largest influence in the aggregate revenue produced by the industry generating approximately 40% of the revenue generated. This is evident for the pharmaceutical industries in the U.S are leading worldwide in production of various drugs into the market. However, other countries contribute to the industry. \n\tChina has a lucrative industry showing the highest growth rates in the recent years. The global outlook in the drug market describes the current state as profitable owing to emerging markets. Innovation and shareholder value in the industry add to the betterment of the marketplace advances.\n\tOn a regional base, North America is expected to continue in growth by a margin of 4.8% in the span of four years as at 2014 to 2018. The growth is driven by the expanse in the healthcare access. The affordable care act has made it possible for the consumer to get healthcare at an affordable rate. In the Western Europe, healthcare spending is slow since they have ties with the euro zones. Contrary, Asia and Australasia public health care programmes and consumer wealth are anticipated to boost the growth. The most prominent area of growth is the Middle East and Africa since they are developing hence expanding access to care creates a more competitive ground for the industry. Another factor that promotes competition in the marketplace is the increasing development in chronic diseases. More than any other marketplace drug market is highly dependent on research and development. Patented drugs makeup the largest share for the revenues accrued in the worldwide revenue. Considering that the industry has numerous fields of medicine to handle, the industry is highly prolific in terms of drug sale since many people have different types of complications. As illustrated in the graphical representation figure one, growth in the industry will continue to prevail immensely. This proves that continued competition is there in the global scene. \nFigure I\n\nSource http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/pharmaceuticals-life-sciences/pharma-2020/market-opportunities-outlook.html \n\n\tIn conclusion, the worldwide drug market is a competitive marketplace for numerous sectors of research. The aptitude to speedily adopt and commercialize new scientific and clinical innovations is essential to acquisition of a reasonable advantage in a changing marketplace. Pharmaceutical companies should come together with health care investors who are adopting the digital media and using expertise, vast statistics, and analytics to progress product development and care provision.', "The definition given to group norms is that they are the informal guidelines to behavior and the code of conducts that provide some order and conformity to group operations and activities, with all the group members expected to follow the rules. Group norms usually develop gradually and informally as the group members learn the behaviors needed for the group to function effectively. The two main types of group norms that exist include behavior norms that define the daily actions of people at work and work norms that regulate the performance and productivity of individual members. Group norms can influence the behaviors of an individual, leading to either positive or negative result on an individual’s behavior, which highlights the need for managers to ensure that the group norms cultivated in the workplace only leads to positive influence on an individual’s behavior. How Group Norms Exert Influence on an Individual's Behavior Group norms can exert influence on an individual’s behavior. One of the ways that group norms exert influence on an individual’s behavior is by leading individuals to shape their behaviors to conform to the rules of the group. Individuals in a group usually aim at following the rules laid by the group to remain in good terms with the other group members and to maintain their status in the group (Miller & Prentice, 2016). Abiding by the rules of the group regularly could shape the individual’s behavior to match that of the group’s rules. For instance, a group where punctuality is the norm may influence a person with a reputation of being late to change his or her behavior to meet the group’s demands. Another way that group norms influence an individual’s behavior is by guiding individuals on how to behave. The rules set by groups that form the group norms usually act as guidelines for the members that they need to follow or risk alienation (Miller & Prentice, 2016). Such rules can influence the behavior of individuals when the members of the group view the underlined rules as the appropriate manner in which they need to behave. Ways Employees Can Avoid the Pitfalls of Negative Peer Pressure Negative peer pressure might derail an individual from his or her objective, as well as influence his or her behavior in a manner that would have a negative impact on his or her performance at work. Thus, employees need to understand ways for avoiding the pitfalls of negative peer pressure. One of the means of avoiding the pitfalls of negative peer pressure is by walking out of groups that are of bad influence on one’s behavior (Webber, Ser, & Goussak, 2015). Employees need to understand whether the group they belong to, is of good or bad influence on their behavior and choose to walk away from the one with bad influence to avoid the pitfalls of negative peer pressure. Another way for avoiding the pitfalls of negative peer pressure can be through identifying and joining groups that are productive (Webber, Ser, & Goussak, 2015). Productive groups are those that focus on improving the strengths of individual members, and joining such groups can help an employee avoid the pitfalls of negative peer pressure. How Employers Can Use Mentors to Foster Positive Peer Pressure Positive peer pressure is the opposite of negative peer pressure, and its effects on an employee are similarly the opposite of that of negative peer pressure. Positive peer pressure can help individuals in focusing on their goals and working hard towards attaining their objectives, which can be crucial in creating an effective team. Employers can use mentors as a way of fostering positive peer pressure in the workplace. One of the ways in which employers could use mentors in promoting positive peer pressure is by introducing them to underperforming groups in the workplace (Cornelissen, Dustmann, & Schönberg, 2017). The mentors would help in mentoring the group members regarding the importance of positive peer pressure and how encouraging each other to attain the collective group goals can help increase their performance, which can lead to the creation of an effective team. Employers could also use mentors to assist in advising groups with negative peer influence to change their behaviors and adopt positive peer influence ideas instead (Cornelissen, Dustmann, & Schönberg, 2017). When those groups heed to the mentor’s advice and in turn, adopt positive peer influence, it may help improve the performance of the team and create an effective team. Conclusion Group norms can influence individuals’ behavior by leading them to shape their behavior to conform to the rules of the group and by guiding them on how to behave. Walking out of bad groups and seeking to join productive teams can be significant steps that an employee could take to avoid the pitfalls of negative peer pressure. Mentoring weak performing teams and those with negative peer pressure underlines the ways that employers could use mentors to develop effective teams in the workplace.", 'In this argument, Anselm does not intend to prove God exists but he has documented his meditation on the idea of how to him God became self-evident. In this chapter, Anselm has defined God as “being than which no greater can be conceived. According to Anselm even the fool who “says in his heart, ‘There is no God’’ can understand the concept of being than which no greater can be conceived meaning that a being must exist in the mind. He states that the concept must not only exist in our minds but also in reality and in that sense that being can be conceived. The statement is self-contradictory because his view of the fool is inconsistent. This is because if human beings can conceive “a being than which nothing greater can be conceived” then that being must exist in reality. The statement is also contradictory since if the fool conceive of “a being than which nothing greater can be conceived” in his mind then he understands the “most perfect being” and thus the fool has already conceived of such a being meaning that Anselm has contradicted himself. Anselm holds that if someone has an entity he or she conceives only exists in his or her mind and if possible it only exists in the mind then that entity is not the most perfect being conceivable since such an entity that exists not only in mind but in excrementally would be even more perfect. This is contradictory since for existence according to him; something or a being has to be conceived in the mind and if conceived in the mind then it exists in reality. In this case, the fool understands the claim that God exists but does not believe that God exists which is contradictory since the mind the fool conceives the existence of God and as per Anselm what is conceived in mind exists in reality.', "Authority and power are attributes that are not associated with black women. There are arguments that women cannot be proper leaders because of their roles, which include being both a mother and a woman. However, the journey to leadership by the black woman has been derailed by gender and racial discrimination. Black women’s upbringing makes them have different perspectives on leadership due to the different ideas. Black feminists have used socialized leadership model because of their environmental and relational character. The prominent influence of the black feminine leadership is deeply rooted in family structure because they are taught to be proud of their culture and backgrounds. Activists term the female leadership approach to be androgynous. Charismatic leadership model dominated the black people politics for the past 40centuries. Despite existing for a long time, the model was still used by Martin Luther. He gets a lot of credit for being vocal and using this model. In the modern world, charismatic leadership model has been used by the people to air their views. The most notable example is black lives matter organization, which has used the model to channel its grievances to the government. Charismatic leadership trait can be co-opted by placing one’s interest at the expense of others, or it can lead to assassination as in the case of Malcolm X and Martin Luther. Malcolm X and Martin Luther are key figures when one is viewing traditional civil rights organization leadership model. I would prefer using charismatic leadership model in addressing important issues facing my community people. Some of these issues include discrimination and extrajudicial killings. Charismatic leadership model requires someone who can air the people's grievances, believes in his quest, and a vocal person. Therefore, the leader should be a person who can command huge crowds and speaks with conviction and authority. By having such a leader, the locals will benefit since the impact is felt. Just like Martin Luther I would use mass action and involve media. In the 21st-century media has been used as a voice by the oppressed and weak. Prompt 2 Most of the American people have forgotten the role of the black people in the war for independence. Thousands of black-Americans were involved in the liberation war, many of the blacks were active participants, and therefore some won the freedom while others died in the war. However, throughout the liberation struggles the blacks vehemently refused to be bystanders and thus giving their loyalty to the surge for liberty and freedom. Civil right activists mostly used non-violent means to protest. However, in some cases, the civil activists used civil disobedience in their bid to bring about change. Some of the civil right activists who strongly advocated for non-violent means are Martin Luther and Andrew Goodman. These are some of the black heroes who risked and lost their lives in the quest for freedom and equality in the black community. Kwame Ture is a household name among the black community since he was among the key founders of “Black Power”. Black power is said to have emerged to counter white supremacy by using violent means. The violence method of liberation was sparked by Malcolm X who was criticizing Martin Luther mode of peaceful protests. Black power grew by the strength and thus led to the formation of new organizations such as Black Panther Party. The parties fought for Black Nationalism and socialism which led to many killings of the white people. In the quest for freedom, the black community used a couple of methods. These methods include; media, boycotts, protests, guerrilla warfare, and dialogue. I would agree with the usage of all other methods expect the use of guerrilla. This is because other methods would not lead to death, violence, and destruction of property as compared to the guerrilla. However, in the 21s- century dialogue seems to be the best system of making your grievances heard followed by use of media due to the rapid rise of globalization.", 'Student’s Name:\nInstructor:\nCourse:\nDate:\nCommunication Gap between Civilian Workers, Military Employees, and Branch Managers\n\nPART I: MEMORANDUM\nTo:\t Steve Galing, lead\xa0analyst\xa0in Directorate of Analysis\nFrom:\t   Riana Brook, Military Employee\nDate:\t   24th March 2018\t\nSubject: Request to Conduct a Research on the Existing Communication Gap between Civilian Workers, Military Employees, and Branch Managers\nSummary\nThe purpose of this memo is to inform you on the existing communication gap between civilian workers, military employees and branch managers working at Directorate of Analysis. Evidently, there is lack of proper cooperation and synergy between among these parties that need to be addressed to ensure effective running of the organization.\nThe Problem \nThere is a belief by some fellow military members serving at DA that there exists a negative feeling towards our analytical capabilities and work ethic. This is in relation to the fact that we wear the military uniform. We as military members feel that we are not considered as having other duties outside our roles at the workplace which we do. The Branch managers at our station, for instance, is less sensitive to our other day-to-day duties which are military related. It causes a significant amount of tension between the civilian co-work and us.\nThere are two chains of command at the branch, the military, and the civilian command. It is unfortunate that the military command prioritizes over our civilian duties and requirements. In most cases, the military employees tend to feel as if they are being punished when it comes to fulfilling our official armed forces duties. Military affiliates are often absent at their desk for a long period of time to attend to additional duties which are not very likely to find with our civilian counterparts. \nBeing a military employee, I can confidently state that from my experience, there is a huge communication gap between the armed forces employees, their civilian counterparts and branch managers. I will conduct interviews with these three group of people to determine if there really is lack of clarity between military and civilian member. \nBenefits of the research\nThe findings from this research will be of importance to the branch manager as he will be able to better understand both the civilian and military employee’s requirements and personal needs. This will result to a workplace with more productive workers, and the organizational climate will become healthier. The armed forces employees will also cease being ashamed for going to events and meetings that are specific to their line of service. Additionally, the branch managers will be able to get clarity as to why the military members don’t have the same work motivation their civilian counterparts do. \nConclusion \nIn the light of aforementioned benefits, I humbly request to allow to carry out this research on communication gaps between military workers, civilian workers, and branch managers and give recommendations on how to improve it. This will promote a healthy relationship between these parties and ultimately leads to the motivation of employees thus increasing productivity at Directorate of Analysis.\nPART II: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIntroduction \nWhen we, armed forces members work in a civilian agency populated environment, we face major challenges. This is because we have a different mindset when it comes to running our day-to-day work assignments. The armed forces members have a lack of motivation at work which is deemed as having bad work ethics. This is because we are trained using military principles that require us to accomplish duties in the most efficient way. This mostly means taking direct instruction without hesitation which has made it hard for us to “create work” of our own when we are not given specific objectives. It also makes the branch managers and other civilian leaders view us as being lazy when the fact is, that’s just how we are trained to function (Weber & Gerde 607). On the contrary, civilian employees have a very different background. They are used to performing their everyday tasks without being given straightforward objectives or having any specific objectives to meet. Civilian employees are more flexible when it comes to working schedules as they effectively apply skills they from school before they came to their workplaces. \nPurpose\nWorking in a heavily populated civilian agency can be a challenge for armed forces members, as their mindset is different from their civilian counterparts when it comes to handling day-to-day work assignments and organizational structure. I, therefore, carried out this report with the aim of achieving three purposes:\nFind out if there really exists a communication gap between branch managers and the military employees as hypothesized\nDetermine if there exist any biases that the military workers have for the civilian workers and vice versa. \nRecommend ways to improve the communication between branch managers, civilian and military employees, as well as help to eradicate the biases these parties have created on each other.\nResearch Questions \nI surveyed 20 civilian employees, 10 branch managers, and 20 military members using the interview-format-like  questions. The questions asked in the questionnaire were:\nOn a scale of 0-5, how motivated are the military employees at the workplace? (Manager/civilian peers).\nHow many days in a month do you spend attending to additional duties involving military events? (military members)\nDo you think there exist communication gap between military employees, branch managers, and the civilian employees?\nPart III: Research Analysis\nFindings \nMilitary employees’ motivation at the workplace\nFigure 1. Scale of employee motivation at work\nOut of the ten branch managers interviewed, 8 of them believed that military employees were not motivated at all. This is because military personnel only carried out duties they were assigned to and did nothing extra like their civilian employees. Of the 20 civilian employees interviewed, half of them believed that the military employees were only slightly motivated for the same reasons. This is because they do not carry out duties unless given instructions; they leave the civilian employees to carry out most of the duties at the workplace.\nii. Hours spent in a day by military workers attending to other military duties\nFigure 2. No of days spent attending to military duties\nMost military workers reported to spending fifteen to twenty days in a month attending to other military duties outside of their workplace.  This means that almost half of their time they are absent from work to attend events and other activities that are military related and not work-related.\niii. Existing communication gap \nFigure 3.  existence of communication gap between military employees and branch managers\nOut of the thirty respondents interviewed, only one branch manager believed that there was no communication gap between military employees and the branch managers. The rest believed that there was a significant miscommunication.\nResults\nAfter conducting interviews in the form of an anonymous questionnaire with ten branch managers, twenty civilian employees, and twenty military joint service members, there were mixed results. Members of the armed forces had a significant more amount of additional duties opposed to their civilian counterparts. Nearly all of the participants agreed there are evident gaps in communication, despite claiming to have a good relationship with one another. This particular part of the questionnaire is somewhat surprising, based on numerous testimonies from military personnel who feel as if there are biases against them. My consensus (although rather a small sample size) is that our organizational climate is not as bad as it seemed to be but there is major room for improvement. Our personal relationships are not the issue, but the communication or lack thereof needs to be addressed. \nDiscussion\nFrom the results obtained above, it was clear that the military employees and branch manager experienced a communication gap. The civilian coworkers on the other did not experience any significant communication gaps with the branch managers. The branch manager disclosed that they quite understood that military employees needed to participate in more extra-curricular activities. Their only problem with this was when the military employees did not notify them about such events in advance. \nConclusion\n It is very unfortunate that miscommunication hinders our full potential of the workforce. As such, it is not right to condemn a fellow colleague based on their technical training or educational background. It is only right to embrace our differences which are very necessary to be combined to accomplish our mission at work. The senior leadership should purpose to open communication channels at the organization, and this will flow down even to the junior staff.it is also important that quarterly surveys be carried out to monitor the progress with the improvement in communication between the military and civilian employees and the branch managers. \nPART IV: Solution\nRecommendations for Change\nConferences to be held bi-annually at the least with division heads of departments and select senior military members both enlisted and officer alike to discuss ways to improve communication gaps.\nIncrease meetings between branch managers and their military employees to discuss guidelines and expected behavior between both parties.\nQuarterly surveys to be issued to the entire workforce that depicts the relationship state between military employees and civilian co-workers.\nThe way forward \nI believe that by sensitizing branch managers on the uniqueness, the military employees have when it comes to execution of missions could help they judge the military employees less. It is very important for everyone at the workplace to note that armed forces are trained to complete tasks when there are objectives and clear instructions. This stems from our training environment, and thus it may take a while to adapt to the civilian way of thinking when it comes to execution of duties. They should understand that even when they themselves would be equally lost if they would be placed to work in a military predominated organization (Mangum & Ball 431-432). \nBoth civilian and military employees have additional responsibilities to their day-to-day work duties. These additional duties are however voluntary to civilians but mandatory to the military employees. We have awards ceremonies, retirement’s ceremonies, promotions, town halls and physical training requirements that they must attend to. These are in addition to the volunteer events we are encouraged to take part in. This always overwhelms us and as one military personnel once said, “It’s like I have to do double the work to get half the credit” (Blaauw-Hara 5). It is important for the branch managers to understand that the military employees struggle to juggle with fulfilling requirements from both the military and civilian chain of command. This understanding should ease the communication gap between the branch managers and military personnel. \nThere should be bi-annual conferences organized for branch managers, senior civilian employees, and senior military members. During these conferences, these parties should engage in coming up with ways of improving the communication among their departments. At the conferences, the military members should be able to explain to the civilian employees and branch manager the challenges they face trying to keep up with at the work area. When these two groups fully understand that military employees have extra activities besides their normal work, they will become less lenient with them. When these two groups also understand how different the civilian and military employees execute their duties at work, they will be able to understand that they are not lazy at work and this will be fewer misunderstandings.\nI would also recommend that the branch managers have more personal interactions with the military employees. When the interaction is on an interpersonal level, they can communicate any concerns they have with each other, and this creates a healthy relationship at the workplace. Sometimes the issues they have with each other can easily be resolved using simple conversations stating their expectations. The branch managers an also have increased meetings with the military employees where they discuss guidelines on expected behavior. \nIt would also be important for the civilian workers to have this personal relationship with their military counterparts. Since they work side by side and their duties might override each other, the absence of military employees at their workstation may in one-way delay or hinder the duties of the civilian workers. When they have a healthy personal relationship, the military workers can communicate in advance when they shall be attending other military events. When they do so, both parties are able to arrange their work in accordance to avoid any inconveniences that might be caused by their absence from work.', 'Popular sources are articles that are written by journalist using simple, understandable and common vocabulary.

Alternative explanations in some instances account for a given part of the increased aggression due to temperatures being above normal. They, however, are not significant in indicating the effects of heat. Hot temperatures are directly linked to increased aggression by influencing feelings of hostility and in fuelling the build-up of aggressive thoughts. \nAnderson also refers to the work of Montesquieu who noted that in the northern climates, people generally have more virtues, fewer vices and greater frankness and sincerity. In moving and observing countries to the south, it may seem that one has moved away from the notion of morality because the people are very passionate when it comes to crime (33). The article Heat and Violence looks into the modern studies of heat hypothesis, which addresses the methodological issues in a number of ways. The research in this portion is based on three broad categories. The first is field studies, which focus on some form of aggression (Anderson 33). Next comes the laboratory studies which are also focussed on aggression and lastly, there are the laboratory studies that are focussed on variables of aggression such as feelings that are hostile, arousal and beliefs (Anderson 34).\nIn the article, Field studies are categorized in accordance to whether they are used to compare the rate of aggression in geographical locations which appear to be similar in a number of ways but different in terms of climatic conditions or in the comparison of aggression rates in a certain geographical location but over periods of time that have differences of temperature (Anderson 34).  The Laboratory analysis of aggressive behavior indicates that in circumstances that are negative, heat leads to increased aggression in terms of retaliation (Anderson 35).  Laboratory analysis and variables related to aggression show that exposure to high temperatures leads to increased heart rates, encouragement of notions that are aggressive including attitudes or feelings linked with hostile behaviour while decreasing the feelings of comfort and arousal (Anderson 36). \nPsychological processes are also linked with the high temperatures overall effect on violence and aggression. The basic but the most common is centered on the issue of crankiness. Insults that are minor are seen as major ones, leading to greater retaliation (Anderson 36). The overall research according to the article shows that in numerous settings, hot temperatures leads to the increase in aggression. Certain conditions present to limit the general overview of such a conclusion but the evidence from the data in the structure is convincing in addition to being impressive (Anderson 37).\nThe view that hot temperature, weather, and violence are related has been proven in a number of ways. It has been shown in different sources, through a number of the past centuries and in many of states in the world. Whether the weather is a direct cause of aggression or is simply a coincidence is hard to determine. In situations where people find themselves in hot weather, the body goes through changes that lead to increased heart rate, circulation of blood and sweating, and changes in the metabolism. All these are linked with the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which is on the other hand linked to the responses of flight or fight. Hot weather also leads to the increased production of testosterone, leading to a situation where people fight.', 'WalMart has steadily grown ever since it’s beginning. Most of its success as a retail outfit is attributable to its history of efficiency in its supply chain management. In 1970 for example, it was among leading companies in the centralization of its massive distribution system. In fact, it was established of the centre and spoke retail system. In this system, the centre represented a huge warehouse where goods were ordered from while the spokes were the individual stores that dispatched the goods. This system afforded it huge cost savings margins since goods could be purchased in bulk and distributed via its logistics infrastructure. WalMart gets goods directly from their manufacturer without any intermediaries thus resulting in additional cost savings. The company invests lots of time performing research on potential distributors’ cost structures. This research is done through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). In this system, WalMart downloads purchase orders and sales information regarding goods sold. Suppliers then ship required goods upon receipt of the EDIs. WalMart moreover boasts of an efficient transportation system with over 3500 trucks. The vehicles are managed by experienced and competent drivers with over 300,000 miles free of accidents or traffic violations. WalMart’s distribution system moreover uses cross-docking, a technique that ensures that goods collected from distributors are shipped directly to customers. Information Technology has also been extensively integrated into its supply chain. This helps in quick renewal system where goods at the shelves are replaced right after sales. The EDI network connects different supply chain stakeholders with the help of Retail Link.\nMajor issues and challenges faced by Walmart in the implementation of supply chain management.\nLike any other company, Walmart faced several issues and challenges. Management of inventory was one of challenges that the company come along. The company lost big chuck of money of about three billion on stock merchandise in 2013 sales because there stock increased more than the sales which were low. Walmart at certain time blamed high tax rate imposed on their income and depressed economy affecting its customers directly, this made the company to record low earning on its first quarter of the year. The technology was to be very crucial if it was integrated into inventory to make it easy to run the inventory management of the company. Although the company was among the first adopters of technology, it failed to make use of the technology fully hence making the workload tiresome to its employees. This led to bad performance on inventory and records management of the company. Updating of its goods on shelves was poor that some commodities lasted longer on shelves without the management noticing the time it has been there. Some contributors proposed the use of Technology like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) this being among the best chips device that can automate tolls. The RFID system that did not require line-of-sight to be interpreted faced numerals challenges of codes failure and radio frequency which was unable to go through metal and liquid well so this couldn’t give out the expected results making the company to go back to the drawing board. The company management failed to secure enough time to its payroll staff hence they perform poorly on all data of company. The accountability in the company was wanting because the management never made clear bill on sales the company made on each year leading to poor inventory records. The accuracy of financial information on Walmart transaction with other companies was not also good.', 'Evaluation of the success of a teaching tool is important in ensuring that it achieves the objectives set by the user, with many evaluation strategies and options being available for the procedure. Concerning my visual teaching tool healthy eating, one of the steps that I used in evaluating the tool’s success in meeting the learning objective was examining the new things that the learners learned from the exercise (Vandiver & Corcoran, 2016). The primary aim of the teaching tool was to help the audience gain new knowledge on healthy eating options that would help them eat healthier. Thus, determining the amount of new information learned by the audience was an important evaluation method for understanding if the tool met its objective. Another step that I took to evaluate the tool’s success was assessing whether the audience integrated well with the learning activities of the teaching tool. The delivery process of knowledge plays a crucial role in determining the success of the tool. Assessing how well the audience related to the learning activities of the teaching tool helped me understand if it was successful in achieving some of the objectives set. The other step that I took to evaluate the tool’s success was assessing the main teaching points of the tool and analyzing their impact on improving the audience’s knowledge (Vandiver & Corcoran, 2016). Analyzing the effects of the teaching points on improving the knowledge of the audience helped in the understanding of the improvement that the teaching tool has had on the targeted audience, which was important in the evaluation of its success in attaining its core objectives. Finally, another step I took to evaluate the success of the teaching tool in achieving its objectives was requesting the audience to deliver feedback on how it helped in improving their knowledge of healthy eating.', '\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow I Plan to Prepare for the Final Exam and NCLEX\nName\nInstitutional Affiliation\nInstructor\nCourse\nDate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow I Plan to Prepare for the Final Exam and NCLEX\nExams are essential in determining if learners have a good grasp of concepts and course materials and can present answers in the most valuable form. The exam period can be stressful to a student; however, with successful preparation techniques, one confidently handle any exam. One of the techniques I plan to use to prepare for the exam is creating a study schedule. I will create a schedule of balanced activities, including time for a break, eat, sleep, socialize and study each subject. Another technique I plan to use is utilizing the resources available to me. If I have questions, I will reach out to my professor or tutor to give me ideas. Also, I will create study groups with my classmates to learn the course materials together. Lastly, since final exams and NCLEX can be stressful, I plan to take good care of my health. I will exercise regularly, eat healthy food and maintain a regular sleep pattern to clear my mind and feel mentally sharp. ', 'Qualitative studies are always subject to criticism on their validity, reliability, and generalizability, based on the philosophical assumptions on which they are grounded (Hayashi et al., 2019). Criticism of qualitative researches is based on the potential bias of the researcher in analyzing and interpreting the data to suit the expected outcomes. Validity is, therefore, a major concern in qualitative design, and the following factors are usually considered in increasing the validity of a research study.\nAccording to Rose and Johnson (2020), the specific research design, sample size, and data analysis are crucial determinants of validity in qualitative researchers. Validity can be increased by ensuring the researcher selects the most appropriate design to obtain appropriate data, analyze and interpret. To further explain the mentioned determinants of validity in qualitative studies, a study by Lemon et al. (2020) is used. The study is qualitative in nature, and the specific research design is phenomenological study, which obtains data from the lived experience of the participants. The purpose of the study was to explore the experience of Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT) doctorate graduates. The researchers’ selection of phenomenological study increases validity because the data is obtained from participants who have had the actual experience of studying MFT at the doctorate level and graduated. The study also used 9 participants, which also increases validity because the expectation is that the experience among MFT doctorate graduates is not significantly different. The sample size is, therefore, adequately representative. A thematic analysis approach was used, which is essentially the standard practice for analyzing primary qualitative studies. The analysis is, however, a major source of bias. Lemon et al. (2020), however, used the Researcher as Instrument Statement (RAIS) to document their self-thought, perception, experience, and opinion about the topic to ensure that the outcomes were not influenced or did not intersect with the findings from the analysis. This method was used to enhance the objectiveness of the researcher in analysis and interpretation.', 'Considering that I am of African American descent, I decided to visit a Hispanic ethnicity group. During the meeting, I noticed some patterns of interaction within the group that differed from the ones accustomed. For instance, I noticed that within the group, the elders had a greater say on the proceedings of the group, with their opinions having a strong impact. In Hispanic culture, age plays a crucial role in determining the respect an individual receives in society (Garcia, 2017). The interaction was different from my culture, whereby the status of an individual dictates the level of influence he or she can have. I also noticed some words and non-verbal behaviors that differ from the ones I usually use. For example, the people in the group referred to visitors as “Pasiero,” which I came to understand that it is a slang word used in referring to a friend. Further, I noticed that the familiar hand gesture of summoning an individual to come over by using one’s index finger extending in and out when the palm is up has a sexual meaning among the Hispanic population. Hand gestures are usually different depending on the culture, which is the reason behind the importance of learning different cultures before interacting with them (Matsumoto & Hwang, 2013). Being the minority in the group that I visited did not feel bad at all. The group was welcoming, and they were so excited to have me as their guest. They welcomed me with some food and drink, and were also interested in helping me learn their language. The reason behind their welcoming nature may be because of their culture of living as a nuclear family, as it allows them to be compassionate to others (Otters & Hollander, 2018). Generally, it was an experience that I cherished.', 'Typically, individuals with disabilities are one of the minority groups within the United States. Throughout history, they were among the groups of millions of people who did not have access to things that a majority of the citizens have access to including schools, public transport, and apartment accommodation. Under the state laws, the disabled did not have rights while others were committed to institutions in which they suffered from neglect. \nThe film\nThe occurrence of the World War II led to a change in above status after a number of people who wanted to live and enjoy their lives just like every other individual came up. This was with the aim of liberating all the Americans who had various disabilities from their limitations, which the government at the time was not willing to accommodate. In light of this, the film Lives Worth Living highlights the crucial development of the pioneers of this period who came to the realization that they needed to come together in order to change the world`s opinion regarding their fate. By a series of demonstrations and battles through legislation, the community on disability managed to secure equal rights of a civil nature for every person with a disability. Because of their efforts, many people`s lives were transformed. \nDirected by Eric Neudel and Released in 2011, the film Lives worth Living is based on an oral history described by the mythical heroes and richly illustrated by use of archived footage.  The film’s story is about Fred Fay who suffered a life-changing spinal cord injury in 1961, while at the tender age of 17 and refused to stick to the sidelines simply because he could not walk. He tirelessly fought for access, equal rights and opportunities for the disabled. This included advocating for a variety of programs, which allowed the disabled to live on their own. He died on 20th August 2011, and the film is a dedication to his life and efforts. The film also features Ed Roberts, who was the pioneer of the Berkeley independent living movement and is regarded as a father of the rights movement for the disabled.\nThe film echoes Martin Luther King`s march in Selma, where disabled protestors leave their wheelchairs and courageously drag themselves through steps leading to the courthouse. On the other hand, we can see activists who have quadriplegia maneuvering their wheelchairs in front of public buses, which are not fitted to accommodate them.  The film concludes with the fight for the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is one of the crucial civil rights legislative pieces, in the history of America. A large number of people who came together in solidarity to change the laws and attitudes showed clearly the importance of human power, self-determination, and cooperation. This was a demonstration that against all the odds, something worthwhile is easy to accomplish when people stand together. The film’s scenes illustrate active participation by disabled people. They are a demonstration of the effort and importance of the recognition of rights for the group. The protests including marching in front of buses that do not accommodate their condition is a clear show of their anger in their non-recognition simply because of their condition. It was a way of showing that things needed to change for the better. Society ostracised the disabled for a long time and time came when they sought recognition as citizens who needed protection too. \nADA\nEnacted into law in the year 1990, ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) is a civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on disabled individuals in all spheres of life, from the job environment to schools and transportation sector. The law also prohibits discrimination in all private and public places, which are open to the public at large. Mainly, the law ensures that disabled people have equal right and opportunities to every other individual. The ADA includes five sections, which have a basis in different sectors of public life. They include:\nTitle I- Employment.\nTitle II- Public Services: State and Local Government.\nTitle III- Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities.\nTitle IV- Telecommunications.\nTitle V- Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\nPhotos: illustrating ADA movement \nHow the film connect to GS 420 class content\nThe GS 420 has the end goal to develop competencies by getting to understand the experiences of disability and how to interact well with people encumbered by disabilities. The film puts us in a position where we get to place ourselves in the shoes of the disabled individuals. In the film, the disabled individuals left their own wheelchairs and crawled up the courthouse steps. Some of them chained their wheelchairs together, and this created a very powerful impression. That of vision, the collective power of the masses, and one of protest against the injustice that was apparent within the disabled community. It was a clear demand for justice and equality for the disabled people.', 'Apparently, special education involves teaching students with some unique education needs in a way that is designed to handle and address their individual disparities and needs. As a prospective special education teacher, it is clear that special education is a process that is designed systematically to enhance monitoring the teaching procedures adopted to equip special education children with the desired education. Moreover, the approach and practice employed to teach special education children is quite different from that employed to teach children with no special education needs. In essence, special education intends to take care of students with mental impairment, language impairment, behavioral disorder and many others. To get a precise view of special education children in a classroom situation, the assignment will focus on a case study regarding a high school student (Mark) who suffers from learning disability. Analysis and characteristics of the case Mark is a disciplined and tidy student who likes doing his things in an orderly manner. Teachers and his classmates commend him for good behavior and neatness. Mark finishes class assignments on time, and his work arrangement is commendable. When it comes to class work, Mark is interactive and asks questions whenever he is not satisfied with the explanations given by the teachers. Most teachers like Mark for being outspoken and speaking out his mind during class hours. Generally, Mark is an excellent student who cooperates in doing assignment and classwork. However, when it comes to exams, Mark performs poorly despite his good character. Actually, Mark has always been a below average student since he joined high school. His parents and teachers have tried using different mechanisms to help him improve, but nothing has changed. The poor performance disappoints Mark and makes him feel demoralized after seeing that all the efforts he puts to improve performance go to waste. Fortunately, Mark has a caring mother who encourages him to keep inventing new studying strategies and see whether the situation will improve one day. Mark’s mother is so optimistic that his son’s performance will improve with time. Essentially, were it not for her mother’s support, Mark could have dropped out of school long time ago. His classmates make fun of him asking what happens when it comes to exams, and he is the class “genius.” The sarcasm from his classmates demotivates him and gives him a thousand reasons to terminate his studies. However, he can never imagine disappointing his mother and, therefore, he has to put up with the situation. A few weeks ago, the teachers felt the need to question Mark’s mother about his upbringing and any health challenges he may have suffered during early years. The response from Mark’s mother showed that no symptoms of brain damage or other related health conditions were identified during his early years. However, Mark’s mother started that Mark used to forget where he kept his playing toys most of the times. The mother had to collect them after he had finished playing so that she can provide them the next time he asked. She also added that Mark had a reading problem during his elementary education though it never lasted for long. Context analysis A cognitive analysis of Mark’s condition reveals that he suffers from some learning disabilities. The commonest disabilities evident in this case are poor memory, poor reading ability and poor understanding of concepts. Such disabilities are hard to detect, and it may take the entire learning period trying to figure out the problem. Mark and other students with education related disabilities face enormous challenges throughout their schooling life if the disabilities are not recognized in time. In essence, the school life for students with disabilities is faced with unending challenges and hard times. For instance, learning disability and language impairment are taken to mean that the student is foolish and cannot comprehend academic concepts taught in class. In this regard, students with disabilities endure tough learning environments that are full of negative criticism and demoralizing experiences. Since the performance of students with disabilities is generally poor, they find it difficult to ascend the education ladder to the next since the teacher may not understand the exact challenge the students are going through. Apparently, a problem cannot be solved without identifying its existence. Therefore as a teacher dealing with students that need special education, it is imperative to determine the causes of poor performance before choosing the teaching strategy to employ in class (Wilmshurst and Brue 108). Individuals with disabilities are unfit to learn in the same facilities or environment with other students. Instead, students with disabilities should be enrolled in viable recreation programs that suit their educational and social needs. For instance, parents, teachers and other stakeholders should ensure that students learn in an environment that accommodates their special needs and that the facilities are of a unique quality to promote a vibrant learning experience. Universal design A universal design of learning can be described as a special framework that guides teachers on formulating and structuring instructions to meet the varied needs of learners. From Mark’s case, it can be observed that a unique teaching strategy has to be adopted to solve the problem. Essentially, it is necessary to evaluate the student performance behavior so that a matching universal design of learning can be development to enhance a conducive learning environment for all students. In essence, students will portray different academic behavior characteristics and, therefore, it is the responsibility of the teacher to deduce the challenges facing each student so that solutions can be obtained on time. Sometimes the parents may not be aware of the exact problem facing their children, but with the help of the teacher and other professional stakeholders it is possible to identify the challenge and come up with an amicable solution.  To solve the poor memory challenge, Mark should be encouraged to use learning approaches that do not involve much memorizing. In fact, Mark needs to maximize on practical learning since it does not involve a lot of memorizing. Collaboration Special education is a complex practice that requires the collaboration of all stakeholders for it to be successful. For instance, some special education needs require clarity from medical personnel and, therefore, failure to involve such stakeholders may result in negative outcomes. In addition, parents are a fundamental component in the transition from childhood to the various stages of human development. Therefore, special education teacher must work closely with the parents to understand the minute facts regarding child growth and development (Wilmshurst and Brue 64). Essentially, it is crucial for the different stakeholders to collaborate fully so that children with special education need can be handled accordingly and reduce psychological torture they undergo in the hands of their peers. Children with disabilities usually have self-esteem issues and can think of taking their lives or doing other dangerous things if they are not shown love, care, and appreciation. Resources The entire process of special education requires resources to facilitate smooth implementation of policies and procedures.  For instance, extensive research on child behavior is a valuable resource that can be used to identify the varied traits of children since special education needs are heterogeneous. In essence, research is inevitable to facilitate classifying children with similar education related disorders in the same category and finding the best solution for this class. Additionally, health institutions and other departments that handle children affairs should be involved in the special education to enhance the provision of crucial information regarding children with special education needs. Professional development The government and various non-governmental organization have established effective strategies to ensure that teachers of special education children are equipped with the necessary skills and resources to handle emerging issues as far as special education is concerned. However, teachers of special education children should be involved when developing policies and the curriculum for special education children. Extreme professionalism is necessary for the provision of education to impaired children with special education needs require varied approaches due to the heterogeneity of special education.  Therefore, sufficient exposure to children with special education needs is a necessity for professional development. A special education teacher should be acquainted with various characteristics of students with special education needs to devise the most professional manner of improving their condition. Conclusion In summary, the case study shows that special education is a unique practice the commands adequate professionalism and commitment. Teachers handling students with special education needs have to possess adequate knowledge, skills and experience regarding special education to succeed in their career endeavors. For instance, Mark had a severe learning disability that required special attention so that he could be motivated to continue with studies. Essentially, all stakeholders in special education must work together to ensure that children with special education needs learn in free and conducive environments. In addition, both the government and the private sector should join hands in building an enabling infrastructure for special education.', 'Fruit Zone India Limited: Designing the Research Questionnaire\n\nIntroduction\nUnderstanding the customers\' perception, attitude, and purchase intention towards a business organization\'s goods and services is critical to the success and sustainability of the business organization. Unlike in the late 20th century, at the start of the industrial mass production when businesses produced goods without necessarily understanding the market dynamism, today, the customers\' desire for various goods and services is the underlying driver of marketing strategies. As Pride et al. (2017) argue, companies no longer just produce goods and services because they believe it can solve a potential market gap; instead, the business organization spends significant time trying to understand the targeted market, the customers, and determine the best way to introduce a new product or promote an existing one. \n\nMarketing research has therefore become an integral part of modern business strategy, with most corporate organizations spending adequate resources in research and development as a separate and functional unit (Vriens et al., 2018). Understanding consumers\' needs, perception, and behavior towards a particular product are crucial in making informed and rational business decisions. Equally important is the specific research methodology used to collect, analyze, and interpret data with respect to particular research questions. Quantitative and qualitative designs are used in varying degrees, depending on the nature of the market inquiry to gain insightful information from the customers (Apuke, 2017). In this paper, a research methodology used to inquire about the customers\' perception regarding an intended new product that is to be introduced into the market is explored. The paper explores the hypothetical case of Fruit Zone India Limited, which is contemplating the introduction of a new type of packaged juice made out of natural sugarcane juice into the market. The company contracts IMI, which is a marketing consultancy company, to conduct market research on the customers\' perception regarding the intended product. The paper examines the research techniques employed by IMI as outlined in the three questions presented in the subsequent section.\n\nAnalyzing the Rationale Behind the \'Projective Technique\'\nTavory (2018) defines the projective interview technique as a research method that targets the unconscious mind of the respondents. According to the author, individuals\' behaviors are sometimes influenced by unconscious beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes. As the definition suggests, the fact that the rationale behind the projective interview technique is to have respondents tap into, surface, and discuss factors beyond their conscious mind that often influence their behavior; without them necessarily being aware.\n\nThe assumption of the projective interview technique is that people commonly use their conscious mind to make most of the decisions; and that in some cases, even the conscious mind is influenced by factors or elements that are beyond the individual\'s control (Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill, 2019). The theory of planned behavior (TPB), for instance, indicates that consumers\' behavior towards specific goods and services is influenced by a number of factors, including social norms such as peer pressure, culture, among others (Tornikoski & Maalaoui, 2019). It is, therefore, logical to expect that the responses derived from the focus group discussion and in-depth interview by IMI are influenced by the participants\' conscious that are both personal and social. \n\nIn the focus group discussion, for instance, the respondents may have been asked to provide the reasons why they would prefer buying natural sugarcane juice over processed one. Assuming that one respondent gives health-issue as the main reason, it is likely that another respondent within the focus group, who would have otherwise had another reason, would buy into the health factor as the main determinant of his or her attitude towards natural sugarcane juice. In this regard, the issue or factor that was otherwise on top of the mind (TOM) of the second or subsequent respondent would have been lost, and the researcher would conclude that health is the most important reason for customers\' preference of natural juice.\n\nAnother reason for using the projected interview technique is to avoid the participants\' pre-determined bias regarding the interview questions and answers. As Saunders et al. (2019) describe, it is common for respondents to provide certain answers to a given research question based on their biased opinion rather than their genuine perception or answer. An employee, for instance, may report that he or she is satisfied with the organizational reward systems based on the biased assumption that a genuine answer such as dissatisfaction may give the organization a bad reputation. In some cases, some respondents may want to act as if they have adequate command and understanding of the research area. As such, they may provide answers based on what they think should be the appropriate response. For instance, a health-conscious respondent may give health reasons as the main determinant for his or her preference for natural sugarcane juice when under ordinary circumstances without being health conscious-bias, the taste of sugarcane would be the genuine determinant for preference of the proposed product. Evidently, in such a scenario, the true factor that influences the choice of the product by the customer may not be captured in the interview, hence the importance of using the projective interview method.\n\nIn the sentence completion exercise, for instance, the respondents were prompted with a sample question as follows "a person who drinks juice is____?" Such is an incomplete question, simple, but has the capacity of invoking the respondents\' immediate response without necessarily thinking a lot or engaging the conscious mind to give an answer. If most respondents respond with words such as "healthy," "unhealthy," "obese," "overweight," and "sick," for instance, the researcher will deduce that health is a major determinant of consumers\' decision to purchase juice. Another question is, "when I want a healthy drink, I buy____?". Again, this question is designed to invoke the respondents\' immediate response without consulting the conscious mind. In an in-depth interview scenario, the researcher may be prompted to clarify to the respondent that healthy drinks in regards to the research question include fresh fruit or processed fruit juice. In the projective interview technique, however, the respondent gives an unbiased response. A person may report, for instance, that when he or she wants a healthy drink, they take milk or water. This would indicate that the natural state of the product is a major determinant of customers\' behavior.\n \nEvaluating the Choice of the Organization in Classifying Customers\nCommon marketing practice is to classify customers in terms of their respective demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and socioeconomic factors such as low, middle, and high-income levels (Camilleri, 2018). Marketers believe that mass consumption behavior is mostly influenced by social norms. For instance, smartwatches for health monitoring are more likely to be purchased by middle-income customers who have adequate resources and health concerns, compared to the younger generation, who might still believe that they do not have significant health issues to worry about (Bölen, 2020). The older population, on the other hand, may not necessarily be interested in smart health watches since their physical activity capacity has declined. Such a classification has a major shortcoming; that of blanket assumption. While the younger population may have less concern about their health, it is normal that there would be a lot of members from the same population who are interested in monitoring their health despite their young age. Such people may, however, be constrained by the relatively high prices of the smartwatches, especially considering that they may still be in college and are not employed.\n\nIMI\'s decision to use non-demographic and non-socioeconomic factors to classify the customers is, therefore, justified. The organization used the following classifications – information-conscious, price-conscious, health-conscious, convenience-conscious, and novelty tryers. Information consciousness may easily be confused with health consciousness. As Glattfelder (2019) argues, a customer who is information conscious is likely to consider the internal and external factors associated with a given product before making the purchase decision. For instance, the targeted consumers of the packaged natural sugarcane juice who are information conscious may want to know where the juice is packed, what variety of sugarcane is used, presence of any additive, among much other relevant information; which do not necessarily relate to his or her health. On the other hand, a health-conscious customer is more likely to be interested in the product-specific attributes that have a direct or indirect influence on his or her health. A conscious information customer may want to purchase the product on the account that packaged natural sugarcane juice provides significant value addition to sugarcane farmers and would help them to improve their economic standards; especially considering that the natural sugarcane juice in the given scenario has traditionally been sold in informal and small-scale business strategy, and fetches low prices. \n\nUsing such classification gives the researchers a better opportunity of understanding the most important attributes of the product that cuts across the demographic and socioeconomic differences. A health-conscious customer, for instance, would buy the product regardless of whether he or she is young. If the research establishes that health factor is a significant determinant, it would be effective for the business to focus its marketing strategy towards health-related information in the marketing and promotion of the product, rather than targeting demographic factors such as age. An advert that emphasizes the importance of packaged natural sugarcane juice for the old may easily be perceived to be biased by other population groups that are not old, and this could adversely affect the company\'s reputation. On the other hand, if an advertisement focuses on the low-cost feature of the product, even the price-insensitive customers may be inclined to buy the same. \n\nProposing an Appropriate Business Research Technique\nA quantitative research technique will be the most appropriate method to predict the customers\' acceptance of the proposed new product. Specifically, a binary logistic regression analysis would be effective in making more accurate predictions. The qualitative technique is equally important in business analysis; however, it is often considered less valid and reliable, especially in making management decisions (Hayashi et al., 2019). Suppose Fruit Zone India is to make the decision of introducing the product into the market. In that case, it is prudent to understand the potential acceptance percentage and the underlying factors that influence the same. Thus far, IMI has effectively used secondary and qualitative approaches to unearth the major determinants of consumer behavior towards the product. However, the quantitative analysis is prudent in the prediction stage because it increases the management\'s confidence in introducing the product.\n\nThe organization should seek from potential customers their perception about the planned product. To effectively the objective, the factors derived from the projected interview technique should be included in the questionnaire together with the factors determined to be major influencers through secondary research and literature review. The most appropriate method to collect the data for this research is to use self-administered close-ended questionnaires. Self-administration of the questionnaires allows the respondent to be less biased in giving their response or answers (Tavory, 2020). Currently, the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly limited the extent to which people can meet physically. The best method for collecting the planned data would be to have the questionnaires administered virtually. It is also vital to have randomly sampled participants. Also, valid and reliable results can best be obtained by using a relatively larger sample size. The organization should, therefore, design the questionnaire on an online platform. The link to the questionnaire should then be shared with the potential respondents on the online platform. As a result, a snowball sampling technique would be appropriate in getting the respondents for the study. This involves identifying potential participants who would look for other respondents with whom they have contact or acquaintance with to visit the online link and fill the questionnaire. A descriptive or frequency analysis would best indicate the respondents\' perception regarding the planned natural sugarcane product. Descriptive statistics, for instance, would enable the organization to determine the percentage of people who would choose the product because of health, benefits, taste, or any other factor determined as a major influence of the customer\'s behavior.', 'Carl Rogers’ understanding of a healthy person or a “fully-functioning” individual as he referred, led him to associate such an individual with qualities like openness to experience, existential living, organismic trusting, experimental freedom, and creativity (Boeree, 2006). After reviewing the article, I do agree with some of Rogers’ concept of the fully-functioning individual and disagree with one. For instance, I agree with the idea that openness to experience, existential living, organismic trusting, and creativity are qualities that describe a healthy person. In my opinion, the ability to accept reality, including one’s feelings is necessary for ensuring individual life a healthy life (Boeree, 2006). Further, I believe that mental health comes when a person understands that the present is the only reality and that he or she cannot control the future or change the past, which is something existential living offers. I also believe that doing the things that come naturally can help people lead a healthy life, as well as doing the best at one’s job. On the other hand, I disagree with the idea that experiential freedom is a quality that defines a healthy person. My disagreement with the idea is that I do believe in the relevance of the possession of free will by individuals. Although Roger’s view is different from that of Maslow and other humanists, it does share some similarities with those views. The significant similarity between Roger’s view and Maslow’s is that they both suggest that it is vital to satisfy the more fundamental psychological needs related to survival before an individual achieves full potential (Winston, 2016). The difference between the theories, on the other hand, revolves around the concept of self-actualization. While Maslow’s focus was on the understanding of the traits of self-actualizing individuals, Rogers’ focused on attaining self-actualization and the development of a therapy that would help individuals overcome barriers that prevented them from achieving full potential (Winston, 2016). Further, Roger’s view of creativity as a factor influencing the full-functionality of an individual is similar to the concept of generativity proposed by Erik Erickson.', '\n\n\n\nHow Race Shaped Class in Early British North American History \n\n\n\n\nName\nInstitutional Affiliation \nDate\n\nHow Race Shaped Class in Early British North American History \nAccording to the early British North American History, race was the foundation for the colonization of the Native people through the enslavement of the Africans and the American Indians. Race provided a common identity among the unequal classes of people and the diverse ethnic Europeans. It led to slavery in British North America, and it merged ideas and prejudices with the aim of controlling labor and lands. However, even before the colonization of North America neither the Africans, nor Europeans, nor Americans considered themselves as equal races. The difference is that the Europeans endowed racial differences by use of force that was attached to legal, scientific, and philosophical legitimacies while the Natives differentiated themselves as ‘red’ and ‘Indian.’ \nThe origin, range, and importance of the concept of racial difference acquired certain political importance in the newly independent America. In the 15th century when Europeans began exploration, explorers attracted the attention of the people they encountered. However, the term races of Europeans, Africans, and American Indian did not exist prior to the colonization of the New World (Foner 2012). The most prominent class of slavery were the Christians and heathen who established social structures such as gender roles, language, material culture, appearance, strength, and subsistence. As the interests relating to economic growth deepened and the colonies became powerful, there arose classifications that highly distinguished Africans or Indians from Europeans. However, in history, there was not any moment that early America had a consensus that the aspect race referred to physical body features only. In early America, the concept race it was recognized as a heterogeneous term that referred to moral and intellectual features that were passed on from one generation to the next. While the Europeans definition of race was purely physical because they viewed Africans as primal slaves, their skin pigment was highly dismissed and was regarded as a savage community.  \nOriginally, the term race signified lineage. For instance, Forner (2012) explains that the noble class or the class regarded as a domesticated breed were very concerned about the purity of their bloodlines. In the 18th century, the Europeans used insinuating terms that dodged controversial concerns of whether the human species constituted of different groups that described the continental distribution of individuals. Looking at the written scriptures, moral and natural philosophical aspects, and the history, researchers, endlessly argued whether the various races shared common ancestry, whether the exhibited traits were natural born or influenced by the changes in the environment. Further, they debated whether the bodies or people’s languages offered the best way to trace descent (Foner, 2014). Therefore, the concept racial theorization was highly visible in the early American republic, as some individuals did not find slavery and dispossession compatible with the natural human rights ideologies while other individuals reconciled substantial contradictions by assuring that the aspect race was rooted in the human nature. \nSlavery was regarded as a crucial institution in early British America. Each region of the colonial British North America allowed the practices of slavery before the American Revolution. For instance, the textbook demonstrates that slavery was important in all areas of life, particularly in the Southern and Island plantations. As such, acts of slavery existed among the Native Americans before the arrival of the Europeans and expanded even after the coming of the Europeans (The Natives and the English, 2013). Acts of slavery came as a result of racial differences, and this made it a dominant institution in some colonies. Furthermore, slavery was not only the major source of wealth but also it principally shaped every element of social classes. Moreover, the development of social institutions such planter class was as a result of slavery. Planter class was the most crucial elite in British America and in the whole of American History. Slavery brought with it the African culture that was later transformed and influenced by exposure to foreign cultural practices and this social perspective became a distinctive part of early British America. \nRace and religion, therefore, played a critical role in shaping class in the early British North America. Europeans highly distinguished themselves from the rest and as a result of viewing the colored as invaluable, they made laws that justified an allowed the continuation of the slave trade. The aspect of race enabled the whites to differentiate themselves from the colored; this builds different classes of people that preyed on the lowly-regarded in the community. However, even before the colonization of the Americans, slavery still existed among the Native American, but it was not as brutal as the foreign slavery (The Black Legend, Native Americans, and Spaniards, 2013). Therefore, the aspect of servant and slaves is an aspect that began before colonization and it symbolizes the foundation of human social existence. There was a time when priests ruled, and it led to the emergence and growth of colonial powers that used the racial distinctions to expand slavery for economic, political and social interests.

The strategy involves identifying a specific organizational problem, gathering high-quality evidence to inform the decision or selection of the best alternative solution. The use of high-quality evidence, which often includes peer-reviewed journals, scholarly sources, policies, and best practices, helps determine the most appropriate strategy for solving a given problem. \nHamlin (2016) found that evidence-based human resource development practices effectively achieve positive organizational change through collaboration with managers in other departments. According to Hamlin (2016), most employees are often inclined towards resisting significant organizational change. Without applying relevant strategies such as effective communication and preparation of the employees for change, organizational performance may be adversely affected. Evidence-based HRD practices, therefore, are change management strategies that have been reported to have a positive impact on change management. Tomczak et al. (2018) also concur with Hamlin (2016) that best human resource practices with a sustainable positive impact on employee motivation, satisfaction, and performance can best be designed through evidence-based practice.\nDespite the positive impact of evidence-based practice in decision-making at the workplace, studies indicate a varying degree to which the practice is embraced and utilized by many organizations, particularly non-healthcare institutions. Management perception and organizational support are particularly identified as major enablers or challenges regarding using evidence-based practice at workplaces. Aarons et al. (2016) argue that organizational leadership and support of evidence-based practice is positively associated with a higher level of adoption and use. Morrell and Learmonth (2015) also report that management resistance or negative attitude against the evidence-based practice is yet a major determinant of low adoption and use of the problem-solving strategies in most business organizations. Another study by Rynes and Bartunek (2016) also confirm that lack of organizational support, including the provision of the necessary resources for practising EBP, is yet a major determinant of the adoption of the practice. \nBased on the evidence presented herein regarding organizational support for evidence-based practice, this research report explores workers' perceptions regarding organizational support for evidence-based practice in workplaces. The report is done on behalf of Rossier School Education, which seeks to understand its Off-Campus Learning (OCL) students' perception regarding evidence-based decision-making in their respective workplaces. \nOverall Research Question\nWhat is the perception of OCL students regarding the presence of organizational support for evidence-based decision-making? \nSpecific Research Questions\nDo organizations provide adequate resources to the employees with regards to evidence-based decision-making practices?\nWhat is the participants' capacity with regards to the use of evidence-based decision-making?\nWhat is the correlation between organizational resources for supporting evidence-based practice and the employees' capacity in using EBP decision-making?\nMethod\nA quantitative survey research method was used to gather the necessary data for answering the research question. A quantitative research design is based on numerical, mathematical, or statistical methods and values to answer the research question (Plonsky, 2017). The quantitative research approach is based on the objective assumption of social phenomena. Objectivity in this regard indicates that the truth or knowledge about a specific phenomenon can best be acquired through the observation and measurement of quantifiable factors of the phenomenon (Park & Park, 2016). Such quantifiable attributes enable the researcher to logically make conclusions that are less biased, valid, reliable and can be generalized in the larger population. In the context of this report, the use of quantitative design enables the task force to make an informed decision regarding developing curricula on evidence-based decision making.\nThe survey is a specific technique within the broader quantitative approach that establishes the distribution of phenomena in their natural or social setting without alternation (Plonsky, 2017). In this report, for instance, the survey design was used to establish the participants' awareness of their organizational support for evidence-based decision-making and resource availability to support evidence-based decision-making; that is, research questions one and two. \nOther than survey design, multivariate analysis was also used to explore the relationship between organizational resources and workers capacity to use evidence-based decision-making practices. According to Chatfield and Collins (2018), a multivariate analysis is a quantitative technique that measures the relationship between more than one observation. Specifically, the Pearson correlation analysis method explored the relationship between resources and capacity regarding evidence-based decision-making.\nAll the participants were off-campus students enrolled at Rossier School of Education. All the participants were under a study-work program, implying that every participant was employed in a particular organization. The majority of the workers were used as top executives/directors, administrators, and managers. Most of the workers had worked in their respective organizations for less than five years, and between 5 – 10 years (43%) and (38%) respectively. Also, most participants belonged to the age group of 30 – 39 (46%). Further, most of the participants (66%) were female, and (50%) were males.\nFindings\nResearch Question One - Do organizations provide adequate resources to the employees with regards to evidence-based decision-making practices?\nA Likert scale of 1 – 7 was used to measure a total item related to organizational resources that support evidence-based decision-making. The scale was designed such that 1 represented strongly disagreed, and 7 represented strongly agree. The participants were asked whether they were provided with informational resources such as academic journals, guidelines, tools and kits at workplaces to promote evidence-based decision-making. The majority of the respondents (16.13%) strongly disagreed, and (14.52%) disagreed. On the other hand, (15.32%) somewhat agreed, and (15.32%) agreed, and (13.71%) strongly agreed. In general, more than half of the respondents agreed and strongly agreed that their organization provided resources, despite a higher percentage of the respondents strongly disagreeing.  \nFunding is yet another primary organizational resource for supporting evidence-based practice. The respondents were asked whether their respective organizations provide adequate financial support for evidence-based decision making. The majority of the respondents (20.16%) disagreed, (16.94%) strongly disagreed, and (12.9%) somehow disagreed. Only (4.03%) strongly agreed, and (9.68%) agreed. The results herein indicate that majority of the respondents indicated a lack of stable funding to support evidence-based practice. The respondents were also asked if they are provided adequate time by their respective organizations to identify and execute evidence-based programs and courses. The majority of the participants (20.16%) strongly agreed. Another (20.16%) somewhat agreed, and (13.71%) agreed. More than half of the respondents agreed that they have adequate time for evidence-based related programs and practices. \nResearch Question Two: What is the participants' capacity with regards to the use of evidence-based decision-making?\nThe respondents were asked whether they use evidence-based practices for decision-making in their respective organizations. According to the findings, (31.71%) agreed, (28.46%) strongly agreed, and only (1.6%) strongly disagreed. A more significant majority agreed that they use evidence-based decision-making in their work. The respondents were also asked whether they are expected to use evidence-based decision-making by their direct or immediate supervisors. The results found that (20.49%) agreed, and (15.57%) strongly agreed. Another majority (19.67%) neither agreed nor disagreed. The participants were also asked whether organizational leaders in their respective workplaces encouraged the use of evidence-based decision making. The results found that the majority (20.33%) agreed, and (13.01%) strongly agreed. Another (15.46%) somehow agreed. More respondents agreed that their organizational leadership encourages the use of evidence-based decision-making compared to those who disagreed. \nResearch Question Three: What is the correlation between organizational resources for supporting evidence-based practice and the employees' capacity in using EBP decision-making?\nSimple regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between organizational resources for evidence-based decision-making and the workers capacity for EBP. The results are presented in Figures 1 and 2 below.\nFigure 1\nCorrelation between Capacity and Resources \n\n\nAccording to figure 1, organizational resources has a linear correlation with the workers’ capacity to undertake evidence-based decision-making. The relationship is positive, which indicates that more organizational resources for evidence-based practice are associated with increased workers' capacity to execute evidence-based decision-making. Table 2 shows the regression results.\nFigure 2\nCorrelation of Capacity Versus Resources \n\nAccording to figure 2 above, there is a strong correlation between organizational resources that supports evidence-based practice and the workers' capacity to perform evidence-based decision making (r = 0.706, P = 0.001). In other words, there is a 70.6% correlation between organizational resources and employees' capacity with regard to evidence-based decision-making. \nReflection\nI have learned valuable lessons in this course of quantitative analysis. First, I have learned that quantitative research is more effective in making an evidence-based decision as it has higher validity, reliability, and generalizability. I have learned that effective quantitative data analysis is anchored on designing appropriate instruments for collective reliable and valid data. A questionnaire is commonly used to collect quantitative data. Secondary data can also be used to conduct quantitative analysis. I have also learned how to interpret results, especially for multivariate analysis. I have learned how to present the percentages of survey results such that more significant percentages are used more to analyze the specific phenomenon. I have also known how to interpret multivariate analysis results including correlation, and regression analyses. I have learned the importance of (P) value in solving multivariate analysis. I believe that the lessons I have learned in this course will go a long way, especially in completing my dissertation, which would most likely use a quantitative analysis approach. I also intend to use quantitative analysis practice in decision-making at the workplace. Using objective, valid, and reliable data in making management decisions such as sales targets could be more effective if I use quantitative analysis. It provides a sound basis on which the validity and reliability of my management decision at the workplace can be determined. In my dissertation, I would use both descriptive (survey) and multiple regression analysis approaches to determine the distribution and relationship of my study variables, respectively. Multiple regression analysis can determine the magnitude of the relationship between variables and the significance of the relationship.", 'Name\nInstructor\nCourse\nDate\nApplication Essay \nRequired Question\nMy preparation for this Economics major began back in high school and extended during my learning at our community college. For example, I took a macroeconomics and microeconomics course at high school and college. I found these two courses very interesting that drew my interest in Economics as a potential major. I was often amazed at how complex economic issues are usually determined by basic underlying principles, which allow for the comprehension of international monetary systems. Mainly, in high school, my curiosity had me asking numerous questions during class hours. I wanted to grasp the concepts behind these situations fully. Therefore, when I joined college, I made a conscious decision to pursue these two courses further. These courses have since offered a robust foundation for my entry into this economics major. \nThe provision of knowledge has improved my understanding of different economic influences and supports decision-making processes. Additionally, the courses have built my confidence in applying the various theories, concepts, and tools in practical situations. Before these courses, the real-life application of micro and macroeconomics, such as the stock market, seemed exceedingly complex and incomprehensible. I found it interesting that Economics could interpret several underlying global issues such as inflation rates, joblessness, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). I have gained much respect for Economics as a major. I enjoy the fact that it is more of an intuitive course where unlike in other fields, researchers get to manipulate existing data to conclude. The knowledge gained during these courses will ensure I succeed in this Economics major and emerge among the best, primarily because they will ensure I am at par with others who have sufficient background in the area.\nQuestion One\nPicking a sporting activity during freshman year at high school is often an excruciating task, especially for students like me who never enjoy sports. I was confused about which sport best fit my personality. During the first two weeks, I interacted with each sport offered at my school to identify which one I could handle best. Despite being poor at all, I opted for baseball regardless of my illiteracy in the sport. I had this firm conviction that I could succeed in it, and I followed my heart. \nMy passion and strong-heartedness saw me excel in the sport that I began getting minor leadership roles. It was not until sophomore year that I realized that the activity molded me into a leader. After a few more semesters of playing and attaining higher leadership roles in the school team, I eventually bagged the role of team captain. Many of my teammates believed in me, and my coach often reassured me that I was destined for greatness.\nDuring my tenure, I learned a lot which I continue to embrace to date. First, I realized that “teamwork makes the dream work.” The team was stronger together than if we all undertook our roles individually. Whenever we would have disagreements as teammates, I would often take a step back and remind the team of how robust we were together, and thus we should fight the issue and not ourselves. During my farewell party, the group decided to adopt the motto “teamwork makes the dream work.” I felt blessed and happy that I had made a difference. A difference that would live for years to come encouraging more students to hold hands and work towards a common goal.\n\n\nQuestion Two\nI perceive creativity as the expression of one’s unique views in a situation that seems blurry hence offering light within this situation. While I often find myself expressing my creativity in various ways, it mainly presents through problem-solving. A few months ago, my sibling came home and seemed burdened with thoughts. I could not help but wonder why he looked disturbed, so I approached and questioned him. He expressed that one of their teachers had highlighted that children were finding it difficult to put on masks heightening their risk of contracting the coronavirus. Therefore, the teacher instructed them to develop ideas that prompt children to wear their face masks more often, reducing their risk of this disease. I encouraged him that he should not worry too much and that I was going to assist him.\nThe following day after a night of extensive thought, I came up with the idea that their class could design masks with cartoon images. Children adored cartoons and often had cartoon-themed backpacks, stationery, and clothes. My parents found the concept unique, and since children love cartoons, they would enjoy wearing masks with their preferred cartoons for long hours. That weekend my entire family took to the internet to download different types of cartoons that we then clipped on homemade masks for my brother to go and display his idea to the class. His teacher and his mates loved his vision, and they chose it as their preferred class community awareness project. Sometimes creativity is within our reach; we need not look too far as most inspirations are drawn from daily occurrences. I believe everyone is creative; we only need the right lens to see it.\nQuestion Five\nMy community college was not left behind in the new educational transformation towards virtual learning, which was hectic for me during the first few months. I enjoy networking, socializing, and making new friends regardless of my environment, which I owe to my extroverted nature. However, the adoption of online learning was one significant challenge I have had to endure in the past year due to the considerable distractions of social media. Knowing myself, at the beginning of the shift, I vowed to avoid using my phone during school hours and only use it in the evening during my free time as most of my classes occurred during the day. However, I lacked self-control which severely damaged my academic record during the first online exam.\nI often daydreamed about what my friends may have posted or the latest celebrity news. My attention declined, and I anticipated the end of the course. I never realized the damage until it was too late. That semester I experienced severe stress as I had backlogs of unfinished assignments and unwritten and unread notes. It took one lecturer to write me an email with a copy circulated to the dean for me to realize social media had damaged my academics. It was a wake-up call for me, and while I could not have thrown away my phone, I made a conscious decision to embrace self-control and self-integrity to adhere to my set school hours and only use my phone during my free time. I also resorted to keeping my phone on silent mode during the day, ensuring I did not get agitated by the tones from incoming messages or calls. The first few weeks were very challenging; while I am not where I hope to be, I can confidently tap myself on the back and appreciate myself trying to be a better student. The following semester’s results were better, and I am hopeful they will get even better, mainly because I have continued to embrace my no-phone usage policy.', 'Michael J. Sandel opens his talk on justice by exploring various ethical dilemmas that affect society. His eloquence matches his fluency on the pages on the air. Justice is evident in his PBS and BBC lectures just as in his writings. In the section, the moral side of murder, Sandel describes a case study of a trolley car driver whose car breaks are faulty. The trolley heads downwards towards five individuals that will undoubtedly die in case the cart hits them. However, Sandel suggests that the driver can kill only one person if he turns. The main question is what the driver ought to do. Besides, Sandel compares the above case with the second version of the trolley, where he challenges the listener to imagine he/she is an onlooker watching the event and movement of the track down the road. As an onlooker, there is a chance of saving the group at the expense of pushing one person on the track that could stop the train. Sandel considers questions of distributive justice and morality in his attempt to explain that the work is not just a historical idea. Instead, it is a journey in moral reflections.\nThrough the case study, Sandel attempts to justify that there is a moral concern about the actions viewed, as just or concerning the right thing that one should do. In his talk, Sandel challenges the listeners concerning the first case, whether the main idea lies on the number count. However, he goes ahead to suggest that the first case is wrong since pushing someone off the bridge even if it is about saving lives is against his will. According to Sandel, the same principles are applied to the two cases since they all involve the deliberate choice end the life of an innocent being. Sandel tests his idea by altering the story and in doing so, he outlines that at times we view moral reasoning as a bridge to persuasion. From the talk, it is evident that some ethical dilemmas are as a result of conflicting moral principles. Sandel pinpoints saving lives and killing innocent lives as conflicting principles. In such situations, he advises that we act upon a particularbelief based on their weight. Secondly, he argues that some moral dilemmas may be due to the uncertainty of the result of the events. \nIn an attempt to answer a question that Sandel posted, one of the students gave a thought-provoking comment. He suggests the second case is an active choice where the victim would not get involved, thus choosing on his behalf would mean going against his will. The comment is in agreement with the presentation since it covers one of the pillars of justice, freedom. The comment answers how we respect freedom. Sandel presents the idea of justice in theright way outlining the essential features that one should consider in making moral decisions. The presentation is portraying the three ways that one approaches ethical matters. Throughout the lecture, Sandel tries to focus on the notion that political philosophy cannot resolve the moral disagreements that happen within an individual. Instead, he suggests that arguments within an individual should aim at bringing clarity to the moral principles that the society highly holds. \nThe Highest Happiness Principle: Putting a Price Tag on Life\nIn the section on the highest happiness principle, Sandel presents some contemporary cases that portray the topic: putting a price tag on life. He gives the circumstances where one can apply the cost-benefit analysis by placing a dollar value on human life. Sandel introduces Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) version of utilitarianism. According to Jeremy, justice says that the greatest principles of morality are to maximize the well-being of a person or society. The whole truth depends on the collective happiness of an individual and the balance between pain and pleasure. Sandel refers to the idea as the “greatest good for the greatest number” principle. According to Sandel, society has rebranded the idea into a practical application known as cost-benefit analysis. Sandel quantifies the idea in Harvard Justice episode 2 as adding up all the benefits of a particular choice and subtracting all the costs. The right choice is one that ensures that an individual is happy to his/her maximum over suffering. In this analysis, the speaker compares the benefits and expenses to a universal value that a dollar contains. \n\tHe presents some contemporary examples where the cooperation used the theory, which needed them to place a dollar value on human life to make crucial decisions. However, the cases gave rise to several objections to the utilitarian logic of finding out justice. One of the students raised a question concerning the logic: is it fair to sum up and compare all the values using a standard measure?  The issue led to a broader discussion concerning utilitarianism. Some people questioned whether it was right to give weight to the values of the majority even when such may be ignored. Although the idea of utilitarianism has remained popular over the last years, Sandle argues that the utilitarian perspective does not consider the individual rights of a person. The notion pays much attention to the sum of the community satisfactions forgetting the rights and freedom of each individual. To defend his stand, Sandle introduces a case in ancient Rome, where the Romans subjected Christians to suffering. This pain could be so great that it outweighs the utility cost of the Christians. \nThe lecture of Sandel is a detailed representation of justice. He uses styles of presenting the philosophical arguments by showing examples of testing the moral dilemmas related to the public’s consent. Besides, the work lecture is detailed since Sandel chooses to present the view of the vital political theorists to expound and clarify the injustice of the underlining issue. He uses an exemplary ethical-political approach where he studies Bentham’s utilitarianism. Through this, Sandel can engage the audience as he approaches the subject in a way that the readers can identify with since at least they know something about Jeremy. In trying to answer the questions on the maximization of happiness, the professor grounds his ideas on the bottom line that when moral reflections turn political when it asks what laws should govern the use, there is need to engage with the public mind as well as leaders to see where to draw the boundary on cost-benefit analysis. His recurring theme is that we first need to know the true nature of activity before we determine the right morals or public policy. \nDo We Win Ourselves: Who Owns Me?\n\tDue to the humorous references on Bill Gates and Michael Jordan, Sandel introduces the concept of libertarian that says that redistributive taxation is akin to forced labor. He questions whether wealth is because of good luck or fortunate family circumstances. Due to the objection on utilitarianism on individual freedom, Sandel introduces libertarians, a notion that holds the individuals’ rights as the absolute thing that is above any moral code. Sandel points out that the ideafavors the free markets and the threshold of the laws of the government. Libertarianism advocates for human freedom rather than economic efficiency and social welfare. Sandel, therefore, argues that the idea relies on the ownership of an individual or self-ownership. “I own myself, my labor, and therefore, I am entitled to the fruits of labor.” Therefore, taxing the rich to pay the poor infringes the rights of the rich. When a person’s income is taxed, one loses the ownership of labor and even to himself (Gollnhofer et al., 2016). \n\tHowever, the objections to this notion are the one that owes those who contribute towards his/her success. According to Sandel, a person cannot achieve success and wealth on him/herself. The professor pinpoints that a person isa product of the social setting from which he/she grows. Secondly, taxation is not slavery since one can choose to work less to avoid tax. Third, even though some success results from hard work, the speakers argue that success is a product of luck. Some are due to favorable conditions and the natural gifts that favor the community. Sandel introduces a libertarian philosopher called Robert Nozick who regards the case of taxing the wealthy to cater for the essentials of the poor as a form of coercion. Robert considers two principles: justice in acquisition and justice in transfer. Through these, Sandel says that the distribution is just if it meets the two policies. However, the main question that students discussed is whether society needs social services to survive. One of the interesting questions is whether one in a system of progressive taxation is obligated to pay taxes. He gives the distribution of wealth in an egalitarian society with the US being the country of choice. Through the analysis, Sandel suggests that one cannot know whether such a distribution is just or unjust by merely looking at the patterns. One has to go beyond the surface and consider the genesis of the whole system of distribution of wealth (Gollnhofer et al., 2016).   \n\tDuring the session, one of the students gave an excellent point while referring to Michael Jordan. He argued that since wealthy people have received a more substantial gift from society, they have to give back to the community. On the other hand, the defender, Joe,provides an analogy of a skateboard, which he owns. Then a group of people comes to ask the skateboard and that is unjust. He suggests that taking people’s belongings or assets is an injustice to them. Although Sandel pictures the idea of wealth distribution in a particular way, the concept of libertarianism leads to some moral objections. For instance, should one be free to give his/her kidney?  What about consensual cannibalism. The Professor, therefore, seeks to evaluate the cost of human life by the numbers. The underlining principles in the discussion are that equality does not mean justice.', 'Student`s Name:\nInstructor:\nCourse:\nDate:\nSpirit Possession \nThe Tale of Genji is among the classic literary works of Japan, composed by a lady-in-waiting and noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu during the early period of the 11th century. The literary work revolves around the life of Hikaru Genji, the son of a Japanese Emperor during the ancient time, known as Emperor Kiritsubo and a concubine of low rank known as Lady Kiritsubo. The tale recounts the romantic life of Genji and looks into the customs of the aristocratic society of the time. The Japanese culture believed in spirit possession. Spirit possession at the time was a reason to explain illness but also reflects a critique of gender relationships in the Heian Court.\n Heian Japan and Belief in Spirits\nHeian Japan was a place where the real world and supernatural connected. People who lived in the Heian period from the common people to aristocrats believed in a wide array of demons and spirits and their capability to influence humanity in a negative and positive way. Hostile spirits were referred to as Onryo, meaning spiteful or vengeful. These included both spirits of the living and the dead. The belief in the spirits of the dead was the most common.  If the death was mysterious or unexpected, the people believed that the dead person`s spirit would become malevolent.  As a practical example, Sugawara Michizane (845-903), a poet, who existed during the Heian period was believed to have transformed into a vengeful spirit. This spirit was involved in vengeful attacks on some courtiers and also caused natural disasters like lightning which affected the royal palace stopped only after a shrine in Kyoto was dedicated to him. Today, he is revered as Tenjin, the god of learning.\nThe other spirit, Ikiryo, means a living spirit that was a unique phenomenon in Japan had roots in its native beliefs. Ikiryo detached from a body of a living person and haunted or tormented other individuals. In the beginning, the person to which Ikiryo had emerged from did not have to be aware of this fact. The possible roots of this phenomenon were things like jealousy, emotions, which were fierce and powerful among other causes. Exorcisms of a special nature had to be performed in order for a person to be freed from the power of the spirit. For Ikiryo, they normally lasted for a period of seven days accompanied with recitals of sutras and burning of special types of incense.\nA wide range of spirits is portrayed in a variety of Japanese folktales, legends, and works of literary nature. In the Tale of Genji, the most commonly known Ikiryo manifests in a different form where it detaches from Lady Rokujo and possesses Lady Aoi. In the scene, which describes her possession, the term Ikiryo is used alongside Onryo and in other instances the term mono no ke that is identified as a “Spectre.”\nLady Aoi and Spirit possession\nThe Tale of Genji includes a number of incidents regarding spirit possessions. Lady Aoi`s case is the most significant at the time. There are two main reasons for the popularity of the event. Lady Aoi is prince Genji`s first wife. In Shikibu`s novel, Lady Aoi is a daughter of noble decent whose father is the Minister of the Left. The couple appears to be at odds with each other, probably due to the age difference between them. Lady Aoi got married to Genji at the tender age of sixteen and the prince at that time was twelve years old. Their marriage was arranged according to the traditional practice of the aristocrats of the Heian period. Since she was expected to give prince Genji a son who was to be his future successor, their romance and later on, her spirit possession became a much-publicized event. \nThe Tale of Genji`s accounts presents the suffering of Lady Aoi as a classic case of mental distress that cannot be cured in any case by medication or numerous attempts at exorcism. Before her possession and death, the preceding chapters consist of rumors of Hiraku Genji`s involvement with a number of women. Lady Aoi gets to hear of these accounts, which cause her to bear a lot of emotional distress and suffering. Despite the fact that she is his first wife officially, she becomes overly insecure, feels neglected and insignificant when compared with the other women that are involved romantically with Genji. \nThe story focusses mainly on the suspense between Lady Aoi and Rokujo. This is the period before the death of Aoi. Rokujo is one of the lovers linked to Genji. She is a widow of the previous prince. Shikibu notes that Genji pursues and becomes persistent in courting her. He finally and wins Rokujo`s affection but loses interest later on. Because of his nature, he pursues other women like Yugao as Rokujo waits for him through long and lonely nights. She becomes overly jealous because of this. \nThe lady Rokujo`s jealousy and later possession of the Lady Aoi can be interpreted as a product of the frustrations and resentment, which are as a result of the society`s polygamous disposition. Rokujo wants to avenge and take possession of her societal status. She was displaced from her position at the court after her husband, the former crown prince died. The lady, Rokujo is worried that Aoi`s pregnancy would lead to a strengthening of her marriage bonds and that she would stop receiving support from Genji. Her jealous spirit, therefore, attacks Aoi and Genji`s progeny in this regard, who is set to ensure the continuance of Aoi`s economic and social standing. \nIn the commonly discussed scene of the quarrel of the carriages during the Kamo festival, there is a struggle between two rival factions. The two ladies are there for their own reasons to watch the majestic procession in the capital with the intention to watch and admire Genji, who is among the attendants. The Lady Rokujo had come to observe the procession with her daughter to “briefly forget her unhappiness” (chapter 9). The struggle was not only for a better carriage position during the Festival but that of the privilege of carrying Genji`s child. This is the privilege of serving as the tool for carrying Genji`s social and economic progeny and all the advantages that accrued or came with this particular function. Rokujo becomes even more miserable when Genji, in his passage, recognizes the carriage of his own wife and pays respect to Aoi rather than to her:\nGenji seemed indifferent to all the grandly decorated carriages and all the gay sleeves, such a flood of them that it was as if ladies were stacked in layers behind the carriage curtains. Now and again, however, he would have a smile and a glance for a carriage he recognized. His face was solemn and respectful as he passed his wife’s carriage. His men bowed deeply, and the Rokujō lady was in misery. She had been utterly defeated (chapter 9).\nAt Sanjo, Shikibu states that Genji`s wife “seemed to be in the grip of a malign spirit” (chapter 9). In spite of the many prayers, chants and the presence of an exorcist who was skillful in the matters, one of the spirits that had inflicted her seemed not only to be persistent but turned vile. The Spirit chose not to make itself known and remained particularly mysterious.  The spirit`s choice not to become identified and its mysterious nature is however not an issue because its link to one of Genji`s lovers seems like the obvious conclusion. Resentment or jealousy particularly is one of the possible reasons for possession by the spirit. Lady Rokujo was among the most likely suspects. The unwelcome presence of the negative spirit continued, and it led to confusion and worry. Shikibu notes “The lady would sometimes weep in loud wailing sobs, and sometimes be tormented by nausea and shortness of breath” (chapter 9).\nConclusion\nThe Tale of Genji is an interesting account of the life of Hiraku Genji, a prince of the Japanese empire who lived during the Heian period. one of the most significant accounts during this time was the spirit possession of his first wife Aoi, who according to their culture was believed to have been possessed by the jealous spirit of one of the lovers of Genji, the lady Rokujo. As per the discussion, it can be seen that the possession stems from resentment and jealousy which stemmed from the polygamous culture of the Heian period in the lives of aristocrats. The gender relationships are the main cause of the occurrence among others which made the spirits to manifest in such forms and afflicted people, like in this case, Lady Aoi becomes the victim of such manifestation.', "Earth Science Log\nWEEK 1: (4 September to September, 11)\n1. Hurricane Dorian \nOn 9th September 2019 the European civil protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) reported the first major hurricane of 2019. The storm caused widespread flooding and destruction across Grand Bahama Island, killing at least 50 people and leaving over 70,000 people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance (ECHO, 2019). The low-pressure system that becomes Dorian on August 23, strengthened to a typical storm on August 28. Dorian is the 4th named storm of the 2019 hurricane season which runs from June 1 to November 30th.\nAt its  strongest, Dorian was category 5 hurricane, the strongest recorded hurricane in Bahamas’ history with wind speeds of 185 mph and a storm surge of up to 23 feet. It majorly affected the highlands of Abaco and Grand Bahama with an estimate of 13,000 homes that have been severely damaged and destroyed.\nHurricanes are also known as cyclones or typhoons. They are referred to as gigantic storms in other tropical regions. They are gigantic storms that majorly roam in the tropical sea of the world, most of the hurricane occur in Eastern Pacific Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. They are formed when warm water, combine with moist warm air, and the wind in light upper level to form the hurricanes quakes. This process starts when sufficient warm and moist air from surface of oceans start to rise up quickly, and collides with masses of cold air. This collision makes the warm water vapor to condense, eventually forming storms of clouds dropping back as rain. While it condenses, it emits latent heat. Therefore, it warms the cool air which is above. Consequently, away is created for warming moist air beneath the sea or ocean. . As the process proceeds on, more warm moist air gets attracted into the mounting storm, and more heat come from the ocean to the atmosphere. Considering that the conditions are constant, there will be no adequate energy for the storm to buildup and form hurricane.\n\n\nWEEK2 :( 11 September to 15 September)\n2 Extreme weather Hits Spain\n Severe weather that had stroked the southeastern region of Spain killed 3 people on 13th of September 2019. The storms had caused heavy rainfall and floods. The New York Times reported that more than 3,000 people had to be rescued from the storm that drenched Spain’s Mediterranean coast. Some towns recorded their highest rainfall.\nThe climate crisis increased the chances of extreme rainfall events because the warmer air holds more moisture. Heavy rains and snowfalls became frequent in Spain. In most recent, Spanish storms recorded 250 millimeters of rainfall in 12 hours. The storm swept away cars and more than 38,000 people were rescued as the government deployed military personnel to rescue people from flooding in Murcia and Valencia.\n\xa0Some people had to be rescued from rooftops using helicopters. This was one of the possible ways to rescue the victim of the flooding disaster. Moreover, four people were saved from the tops of cars by boat and Jet Ski as was reported by the New York Times. CNN reports that a car was trapped in the tunnels and one man was drawn during the flooding (Goillandeau, & Kolirin). The deluge closed the airports of Murcia and Valencia as well as train lines, roads, and schools.\nThe region was in for a lengthy recovery. Some properties were destroyed by the storm. The storm displaced thousands and destroyed at least 300,000 hectares of agricultural land (EL PAIS). The downpour forced the closure of airports in Almeria and Murcia as well as electricity lines, major roads, and schools. The Authorities asked the residents to avoid driving along the vulnerable regions. All the business operations stopped in the affected areas.\n\n\nWEEK 3 (15 Sept to 18 September)\nGuatemala Torrential Rain\nOn 10th September 2019, the national coordinator for the reduction of Disaster (CONRED) reported that due to heavy rains during the first 9 days of September, over 40,000 people have been affected in the departments of El Progresso, Guatemala, Huehuetenango, Petén and Suchitepéquez of which 105 people were evacuated and nine houses were reported with server damage.\n\xa0On 30th September CONRED reported another heavy rain and landslide affecting Alta Serapes, Santa Rosa and Sololá. A total of 20,246 people and 44 houses were affected, 44 people were injured, and 230 people were evacuated due to the heavy rains and floods. They reported one death due to severe weather and finally, major highways and 10,000 vehicles were affected. The landslide affected thousands of people in Guatemala.\nINSIVUMEH, which provides weather service, noted that a low-pressure system which moves over the Pacific Ocean towards the Mexican coast caused the heavy rainy conditions. The heavy rains destroyed many brides and homes. The disaster displaced many families who stayed along with the most affected areas.\xa0Guatemala Torrential Rain has also been known to create severe weather. It causes both floods and landslides that turn streets into raging rivers.\nFollowing the floods caused by the strong rains in Guatemala European Commission provided $90,000 in humanitarian aid to assist the affected people. This assistance supported the Guatemalan Red Cross in delivering much-needed assistance to the flood victims and even the vulnerable families. River levels increased due to the heavy rains including San Francisco and San Marcos rivers in Izabal. Some lakes also have their water levels increased. The Disaster officials said the severe weather condition was as a result of cold fronts in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWEEK 4 :( 18 September to 25 September)\n4. Tropical Storm Karen Forms\nWhile tropical storm Karen continues to creep nearer to Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, forecasters noted that a section of the Caribbean should prepare for tropical stormy winds, and heavy rainfall. This   may cause flash flooding (Brink, 2019). According to San Juan’s National Weather Service, the center of tropical storm Karen is about 70 miles south of San Juan and has maintained maximum sustained winds of 40mph as it moves north at 7mph. on September 24, Governor Wanda Vazquez declared a state of emergency in preparation for the tropical storm. He advised for suspension of classes and activation of the National Guard. Government employees asked to stay home.\nPuerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands recorded reduced flooding, landslides power outages during the occurrence of Tropical Storm Karen. The schools remained closed, and even Crews temporary closed some coastal roads in southern Puerto Rico. The flood left more than 29000 customers without power at one point lowering the business and economy.\nOn 23rd September the tropical watches placed in both areas. That night recorded a 6.0 magnitude of an earthquake followed by at least three aftershocks. Tropical storms result from heated air above the sea when the temperature rises to 27ºC. There rising air cools and condenses to form clouds. The disaster caused panic among people within and outside the region. However, no damage or death was reported.\nJust like the hurricane tropical storms affect the regions in the tropical regions and affect both human life and properties. Destruction of properties was recorded as hurricane quakes in the tropical regions due to high heating on the ocean and exchange of the heat in the atmosphere. This was the fifth hurricane recorded in the Puerto Rico U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n\nWeek 5 :( 25 September to 2 October)\n5. Deadly Pakistan Earthquake \nOn 25th September the deadly earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 killed 38 people and injured hundreds of more people in Pakistan. Military forces tried to rescue the people injured. The quake's epicenter was close to the city of Mirpur, in Pakistan. It causes cracks on roads, the tall buildings collapsed and people lose their residences. Pakistan’s military offered the displaced people with relief food, tents, drinking water, and medical services to the worst affected areas.\nThe worst impact of the earthquake was felt in areas such as Manda, Jatlan and Afzalpur . The chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), noted that in the main road along river Mangla suffered serious damage. Though the Magla dam was spared, the dam’s powerhouse was closed resulting in a great loss of 900 megawatts to Pakistan’s national power grid.\nForty people died and more than 850 were injured according to the report published on 26th September. Of those who died 33 were from Mirpur district, 4 in Bhimber and one in Jhelum district. Reuters reported that the larger number of casualties was due to shoddy building construction methods and lower construction standards in Pakistan. It had both economic and social impact on the people. A large number of people died due to the collapse of old houses.\nOn 26th September at 12:30 noon, two days following the major earthquake, there was another earthquake hit Mirpur, which caused additional damages .1 people died while 67 were injured. It was of magnitude of 4.7 and epicenter at Thothal Mirpur at 10 kilometers depth. The standard construction of buildings would have reduced the extent of damages of the Deadly Pakistan Earthquake.\n\nWEEK 6 :( 2 October to 9 October)\n6. Record-Breaking Snow in Montana\nOn September 30, snowfall fell on Montana. The city of Great Falls got 9.7 inches on 29th September and another 9.6 inches on 30th September. Other cities saw more than 30 inches of snowfall as was reported by CNN (Holcombe, Jones, & Waldrop). The government declared a state of emergency following the early arrival of the severe winter season before the beginning of October in Glacier, Lake, Clark, Cascade, Lewis, and Flathead. It also included Pondera, Teton Lincoln, and counties.\nThe snowfall caused a change in temperature with as low as 10 to 15 degrees in the forecast. There were delays in the transport areas. The major roads were closed due to extreme weather conditions. Moreover, warnings were issued by the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office, in cooperation with the Montana Department of transportation. The heavy wet snow tribal roads crews making them take longer than usual. Additionally, people were asked to remain patient and stay off the roads to allow the roads crews to do the work.\nThe storm led to heavy accumulated amount of wet snow with three feet in certain regions. Trees and power lines were downed by Heavy winds leading to road closures and power outages. The hard freeze could bring additional agricultural impacts to farmers who were in the snow-covered fields. There was at least one vehicular accident amid slippery roads. Also, many cars slipped into ditches and even flipped over on 4th October. The social and economic activities in most areas were delayed by the snowfall. The two-day snowfall total of 19.3 inches in Great Falls is the second-highest snowfall of any time of the year. The only winter storm that produced higher two-day snow as measured by NWS. The snowfall caused a devastating experience in Montana.\nWEEK 7 :( 9 October to 16 October)\n7. Strong mag Earthquake in Adak, Alaska (USA)\nA magnitude of 6.3 earthquakes was reported on Saturday at 4:54 p.m. 65 miles from Alaska according to the U.S.A Geologist survey. There were no tsunami warnings issued and it occurred when for the past 10 days there was no earthquake of magnitude 3.0 or greater centered nearby. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 15.6miles. This was according to quakebot auto-generation news, a computer application that monitors the latest earthquake detected by USGS.\nWhen the earthquake occurred, tension build up in the solid rock was abruptly released along the fault lines. The pressure released if the rock break just along the fault was converted into seismic waves that radiate from the origin. The energy involves largely depends on the magnitude of the earthquake. Larger earthquakes release much more energy than smaller earthquakes. During this process, the stressed rocks release forces and tremors. The release force shakes the local geography. This earthquake covered 25.1 km depth and the epicenter latitude and longitude were at 51.5271N and 175.5593 W in the United States. It had estimated release energy of 2.7 atomic bombs.\nThe volcano was felt by many residents from Alaska (Volcano Discovery (24 November 2019). It caused tremors on a large area of land. The disaster affected tall buildings and industries. The force destroyed some estates and even causes loss of life to some individuals. Also, the strong mag Earthquake in Adak caused destruction of properties and fear as many people felt the tremor. The disaster had an adverse impact on the human population and its economic activities. Some people feared and migrated with the whole family. It is recorded as some of the largest earthquakes in the USA in September 2019, especially in ESE of Adak, Alaska.\n\xa0\nWEEK 8: (16 October to 23 October)\n8. Kenya Flash Floods\nHeavy rainfall in many regions of Kenya since the start of the short rains season in early October has led to reverie and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides. According to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) more than 100,000 people have been affected in the north-Eastern, central and coastal regions of Kenya. The KRCS has confirmed that at least 14,000 people have been displaced majorly people in the low laying areas where river bursts their banks. It has killed at least 29 people as the Daily Nation media reports it in Kenya.\nOn 1st September the KRCS reported the destruction by flash floods in the Kenyan national park that led to the death of six people and one tourist is still missing. This occurred at Hell’s Gate National Park and was broadcast over the CNN report (Regan, & Adebayo, 2019). Destructions and damage of key infrastructure including roads, bridges, schools, and health facilities have been reported in multiple locations. The rain has destroyed at least 983 acres of farmland and killing of over 21,710 livestock washed away.\xa0\xa0\nThe heavy rains and floods follow a prolonged period of drought in Kenya. Two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall and high land surface temperatures in many areas led to poor crop and livestock production and rapid deterioration of rangeland resources, according to the latest Integrated Phase Classification report (IPC). The heavy rains cause floods in steep valleys in hilly areas on 20th October. The most affected areas are low laying regions with a poor drainage system. Moreover, Kenya flash flood is heavily experienced along small waterways. The KRCS reported that the frequency and intensity of the flooding may increase due to local geography and erratic weather condition.\n\xa0\n\nWEEK 9 :( 23 October to 30 October)\n9. Earthquake in Solomon Island\nThe earthquake and tsunami experienced in the Solomon Islands stroked along a subduction zone, the same geological setting responsible for the world’s most powerful earthquakes. In the subduction zone, two of the earth’s electronic plates convene and one slide under the other into the layer, the lower deposit below the crust. The Island of Solomon is located above the collision amid the Australia and Pacific plates. In the region of the latest magnitude 8.0 earthquake, the Australian plates dive beneath the pacific plate towards the east-northeast at a geological speed of 3.7 inches per year.This is based on report of the Incorporated Research Seismology Institution - (IRIS).\nThe earthquake experienced at depth of 17.8miles and was the second-largest in the Solomon island region in almost the last 40 years as described by IRIS. The tsunami generated by the earthquake reported as 3 feet in height, villages on the Island of Santa Cruz and destroyed homes. The news reporters also noted the structures which were vandalized.\nThe Solomon Islands is experiencing rising sea level that could have a devastating effect on agriculture. There was an earthquake on 28th October 2019 with mag. 4.8. During the earthquake, there were reports of damaged and collapsed houses and hospitals. People fled to higher grounds. About 34,000 people in Makira, South Malaita were affected by the widespread destruction of their homes, food sources, and livelihood.\nEarthquake in Solomon Island is one of the natural calamities which are common along the subduction zone\xa0The World vision has actively deliver services to ensure the affected people get clean water, sanitation and hygiene. They have also created economic empowerment, preventing gender-based violence, disaster planning and prevention, maternal and child health care. Moreover, they have established nutrition to help reduce the disaster and assist the affected individuals in the Solomon Island.\n\n\nWEEK 10 (30 October to 6 November)\n10 The Mindanao Philippines Earthquake\nMore than least four people were confirmed dead and many others were injured after a third in a series of strong earthquakes shook the southern Philippines on Thursday Morning of 31st October 2019, sending many residents to panic. The U.S Geological team of Survey said the epicenter of the 6.5 magnitude quake was in close proximity to Makilala town in Cotabato Province .It is located in the Island of Mindanao. It was about 10KM deep.\nIt was close to the 6.6 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday of the same week that trigged landslide and caused several damages and death. The current data shows that there was no serious damages as recorded in Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology ( PHIVOLCS ).\nPictures posted on social media on that day showed several buildings damaged in the cities and various cracks and injuries in the cities of Kidapawan and Davao, the home town of the country’s president. This even caused a crack in the president’s palace wall though he remained safe. In the Makilala town, a village Chief was found dead under the rubble of the village hall. A video posted showed people being rescued from the roofs of an evacuation center with various injuries in the part of Makilala.\nMany people died as the Philippine daily report showed that a 20-year-old man was killed by a tree falling on him and a woman buried with the debris. Other people were also killed by collapsed houses. According to the office of civil defense, 2,700 houses collapsed including hospitals and schools. The major cause of the quakes is the location of the Philippines, along the Pacific Ring of fire where major earthquakes of the world take place.\n\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\nWEEK 11: (6 November to 13 November)\n11. Makulu Indonesia Sea, Earthquake\nMakulu Indonesia Sea earthquake was a strong earthquake of magnitude 7.1 that awakened the residents causing some runoff from their homes to higher places in panic. The powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian coast in the Molucca Sea, creating the risk of tsunami in nearby areas.\nIt was centered 140 kilometers northwest of Ternate in the Makulu province, this happened after the Indonesian Meteorology, Climate, and Geophysics Agency issuing a warning to people to stay away from the coastline. The earthquake affected the activities of many residents from North Makulu and North Sulawai as reported by Kompas Tv. Also, The US Geological Survey reported the magnitude of 7.1 earthquakes when it occurred early Friday morning (The Associated Press, 2019).\nThe Kompas Tv also reported that government officials in the North Makulu prepared for a possible evacuation of residents. Some patients were also evacuated from their rooms in the hospitals to prevent any injury by the quake.\nThere were no injuries or damage reported, the center of Pacific Tsunami had warned waves would only be possible within 300 kilometers from its epicenter. It also reported no tsunami risk for more distant areas. The warning by the government agencies in the country helped the residents from dangerous damages as Rahmat Triyon a senior official at the agency says there were warnings especially issued for the eastern part of North Sulawesi. He also reported that the depth of the earthquake was 73km deep.\nThe 13th November 2019 earthquake in the Indonesian sea was a very powerful quake with a higher magnitude than other earthquakes of the month. The prior warning prevented the damages and loses to the residents of the country.\n\nWEEK 12 :( 13 November to 20 November)\n12. Volcanic Eruption in White Island.\nWhite Island is in the Bay of Plenty 50km off the North Island’s east Cost of New Zealand’s most active volcanoes. It is well known for its particular crater with strong hydrothermal activity and Sulphur deposits. The White Island is part of the Taupo active volcano zone.\nThe GeoNet recorded a deep earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9M that occurred beneath the Bay of White Island, New Zealand on the 18th of November 2019. There has been no change in the volcanic activity after the days’ event (Volcano Discovery, 2019). There were moderate gas emissions and volcanic tremor remained at moderate levels.\nThe Crater Lake level did not change over the period, but gas-driven fountain activities continue to be seen around the active vent on the western side of the crater floor. The fountain regularly throws mud a few meters into the air at the vent but at the current levels does not cause harm to visitors. However, the potential eruption has been a cause of worry among the people staying within the region.\nThe regulated parameters continued to be in the normal range of volcanic strife and linked disasters. The observations made were similar to the ones made in 2011-2016. And White Island may be leading into a period where the eruptive tremor is more likely than normal.\nThe eruptions have caused many hazards on the Islands Mountains and also to the people leaving around the craters on the island of the magma eruption. The emission of these harmful gases has led to the migration of the people who settled near the crater to a distant place. Unfortunately, the sudden eruption has always led to the death of people by the gasses and the hot magma.\n\nWEEK 13: (20 November to 27 November)\nThe Kenyan Mudslide\nKenya’s interior minister says 29 people have been killed in a mudslide on 26th of November. There were a total of 34 people who died on Saturday as a result of flooding in East Africa. Heavy rainfall outpoured overnight and caused floods in some parts of Kenya. Fred Matiangi, the Cabinet Secretary for Interior, notes that 17 people died in Pokot Central District. The other affected areas by the mudslide included the village of Parua and Tapach where 12 people lost their lives in South Pokot.\nThe County Commissioner of West Pokot records five other people who died when a car drawn on the road when two rivers overflowed their banks. The flooding affected over one million persons in East Africa (Aljazeera, 2019). The international Red Cross Committee said that in November this year many people have been reeling from earlier severe drought. The rains in parts of Somalia, South Sudan are expected for the next four to six more weeks.\xa0\nThis landslide is majorly due to heavy rains that have come after a long period of drought in the North-Eastern part of Kenya. The areas experience drought and have no trees or plants and crops to protect the soil from heavy erosions. The top soil is eroded and deposited in the rivers. Consequently, the rivers increase in size and break the banks causing heavy landslides.\nThe landslide has led to the displacement of many Kenyans. Over 10,000 people who are displaced and livestock have been carried away by the landslides. Most farmers in the affected areas are highly affected as their crops, and top fertile soils have been carried away. The ground is left full of floods and water.", 'According to the article The Multinational Corporation as a Political Actor, globalization together with the increased participation of non-state actors in global affairs shows the shift in relations of power (Detomasi, 2015). This, in turn, leads to the speeding up of national economies’ integration and the convergence of reforms in different issue domains. Every decision which Multinational Corporations make about whether and how to contribute to governance highly depends on the domestic system of business-to-government relations from where they originate. However, the contemporary conceptions have limitations; they do not consider the increasing relevance of the corporate form of statism where the home government maintains a large share of the country’s multinational corporation (Detomasi, 2015). \nIn this article, Detomasi provides a framework which can examine in depth the political role which multinational corporations can play in enhancing the global economy. According to the article, globalization has over the years enabled multinational firms to access new markets and increase their customer base which in return increases sales and revenues for the company (Detomasi, 2015). The joint ventures, the operational partnership enables these corporations to participate in the economy of the host nation lucratively. Geppert asserts that the participation in foreign markets alters the host country’s financial architectures together with product development research and strategies (Dörrenbächer, & Geppert, 2011). \nThe article provides both the positive and negative roles that Multinational Corporations play regarding ensuring political and economic stability in both domestic and host countries. According to the research and report by Scherer, it was evident that most MNCs had the potential to obtain a competitive advantage if they contributed in filling governance gaps in host nations (Scherer & Palazzo, 2011). On the positive side, the participation of MNCs in the political aspects of a country helps in solving issues such as unemployment and distribution of resources. \nOne of the strengths of the arguments is the use of various models such as the statist corporate model and the private or finance capitalist model to argue out multiple works of literature on the role which MNCs play in the global economy. Through these models, the article provides evidence-based examples from rapidly growing markets like Japan, by focusing on the drastic rise of the Japan Inc in the post-war economy (Detomasi, 2015). The author provides both the negative side where State-owned organizations have failed to achieve competitiveness such as Russia and also provides critical examples of areas where state-owned organizations adequately contribute to the economic growth of both host and domestic countries in which these firms operate. This helps the reader to understand the article better and understand the various roles that MNCS play in the global political and economic development. \nIn conclusion, through the use of research materials and critical models of corporate ownership and participation in political affairs the article offers various ways through which MNCs perform political roles. The article focuses on how MNCs interact with host states and means through which national government regulate the behavior of multinational corporations. In addition to this, the article highlights the varieties of capitalism in the modern global economy. It shows that multinational corporations play a critical political role in combating various social issues such as unemployment and uneven distribution of resources.']
